"""Draft a reasoning-surface.json skeleton from an unstructured text blob.

The Reasoning Surface is the canonical artifact episteme produces before a
high-impact decision. Hand-authoring one from scratch is the single biggest
adoption friction. This module takes a Slack thread / PR description / ticket /
email and emits a draft surface the operator can edit in 5 minutes instead of
authoring from a blank file.

The draft is deliberately *imperfect*:
- Heuristics are declared, not hidden — every extracted field lists its source
  and the matching sentence so the operator can confirm or overrule.
- `disconfirmation` is never auto-filled — the whole point is that the operator
  declares it, so we emit an empty array with a visible reminder.
- `core_question` is extracted only if the input contains a question sentence;
  otherwise a placeholder is emitted and the operator is required to write it.

The output validates against `core/schemas/reasoning-surface-v1.json` when
filled in — but the draft itself intentionally contains placeholders the
operator must resolve.
