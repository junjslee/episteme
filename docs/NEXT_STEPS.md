## Resume here — v1.0.0 RC · **FRESH 7-DAY SOAK ACTIVE** · pipeline healthy · **All 6 pre-soak CPs + Roadmap + Hermes/Langfuse scans + Event-53 audit + Event-54 first-external-user response & docs consolidation (Events 47-54)** · next session resumes cold (last touched 2026-04-25)

> **🟢 Event 54 (2026-04-25) — `INSTALL.md §4` + `docs/` consolidation.** First external-user issue (#14, cheuk-cheng) surfaced the README→first-run gap; closed by adding `INSTALL.md §4 First run on your repo` (the plugin→Claude-Code-session→cwd→`.episteme/` chain + strict/advisory/off branching) AND a docs-cluster cleanup pass: deleted `CLONE.md` + patched `clone.yml`, renamed `docs/EPISTEME_ARCHITECTURE.md` → `docs/LAYER_MODEL.md`, archived 4 superseded design/PRD docs to local `/archive/` (gitignored, repo-root). All cross-refs updated (README, llms.txt, docs/README, kernel/PHASE_12_LEXICON, docs/PLAN). Issue #14 reply drafted; operator posts after the branch lands on master. Pure docs/workflow; soak-safe.



> **🟢 Fresh 7-day soak clock ACTIVE** since `2026-04-23T21:23:36Z` (Event 38 verification confirmed episodic writer + 3 sibling PostToolUse Bash hooks all firing on real ops). Target close **`~2026-04-30`**; extension to `~2026-05-07` acceptable per operator-availability window (7-day minimum is statistical validity, not calendar deadline).
>
> **Day-7 grading workflow.** Two operator commands produce a defensible GA / no-GA baseline (Event 48 already ran `episteme profile audit --write` so Gate 25 is now live data; operator should rerun it closer to Day-7 to capture a larger sample):
>
> ```bash
> # Refresh Phase 12 audit against post-Event-38 record volume growth (optional)
> episteme profile audit --write
> # Phase 1 — run the automated grader
> python3 tools/grade_gates.py
> # Phase 2 — dedup + classify deferred discoveries
> python3 tools/sample_deferred.py --unique
> ```
>
> Per-gate rubric in `docs/POST_SOAK_TRIAGE.md`; discriminator methodology in `docs/DISCRIMINATOR_CALIBRATION.md`; Phase-2 reviewer-classification in `docs/DEFERRED_DISCOVERIES_TRIAGE.md`; prepared patches for v1.0.1 hook fixes in `docs/PREPARED_PATCHES.md`.
>
> **Baseline as of Event 48:** **3 PASS** (Gate 21 reasoning-surface quality · Gate 25 audit detected `asymmetry_posture` drift · Gate 27 failure-mode citations) · 1 FAIL (Gate 26 — CP-FENCE-01 deferred) · 3 MANUAL (Gate 22, 23, 24, 28) · **weighted 3.0/4.0**. One favorable MANUAL resolution (most likely Gate 28 dogfood audit on Events 36-48 kernel/doc commits) lifts weighted to 4.0 → **GA threshold hit**. Path Y (apply CP-TEL-01 + CP-FENCE-01) lifts Gate 22 + 26 into PASS/PARTIAL range → **GA candidate strong**.
>
> **Session of 2026-04-23 → 2026-04-24 shipped Events 36 through 53** across six arcs — Path A pipeline resurrection (Events 36-38), soak-safe diagnostic follow-through (Event 39), distribution + positioning polish (Events 40-45), post-soak triage rubric + Gate-25-PASS (Events 46-48), Path Y mid-soak hook fixes (Events 49-50), and post-v1.0 roadmap + adjacent-ecosystem scans + audit (Events 51-53, Hermes + Langfuse + roadmap audit). Compact recap:
>
> - **Events 36-38 (Path A pipeline fix).** Day-2 Gate Grading on fresh soak surfaced that 6 of 8 cognitive gates were ungradeable due to a silent `except Exception: pass` in `episodic_writer.py` + `fence_synthesis.py`. Root cause surprisingly **was not** a writer bug — it was that `src/episteme/adapters/claude.py` `build_settings()` never registered the 4 PostToolUse Bash writers with Claude Code's settings.json since CP7/CP8. Writers were invocable but never invoked. Event 38 registered all 4; post-push verification in `~/.episteme/state/hooks.log` confirmed all writers now fire on real ops. Fresh soak clock opened at that verification timestamp.
> - **Event 37 (Gate 27 resolution via Path 4A).** Separate finding: the apparent "failure-modes taxonomy not cited in real work" gate result was a measurement-dimension mismatch, not fragmentation. `flaw_classification` enum and FAILURE_MODES taxonomy are **orthogonal axes** (artifact-state vs cognitive-mode), both load-bearing. Resolution: kernel/FAILURE_MODES.md gained a "Two-vocabulary distinction" section explaining the axes; no merge.
> - **Event 39 (loud-failure follow-through).** Applied Event 36's `_hook_log()` pattern to the two sibling PostToolUse Bash writers (`state_tracker.py` + `calibration_telemetry.py`) that hadn't been instrumented. Completes the coverage; next push after this would surface any silent failure class remaining.
> - **Events 40-42 (distribution + CI ergonomics).** Korean storytelling README rewrite + Spanish + Chinese focused-scope READMEs + `/readme/{es,zh}` routes + 4-locale Header switcher + OG image at `/opengraph-image` + release-please CI with job-level permissions + hook path canonicalization via `_canonical_project_root()` (git rev-parse → walk → cwd fallback). Hook-path fix eliminated the `REASONING SURFACE MISSING` friction that hit repeatedly when Bash-tool cwd inherited from `pnpm build` in `web/`.
> - **Events 43-44 (epistemic-trust positioning).** Integrated vocabulary from *Architecting Trust in Artificial Epistemic Agents* across marketing surface (Hero + layout metadata), governance surface (FAILURE_MODES mapping section), both README languages (English storytelling + Korean storytelling inserts for Epistemic Drift / Robust Falsifiability / Knowledge Sanctuaries + positioning claim *"socio-epistemic infrastructure for Claude Code"*), and kernel/REFERENCES.md as a new "Positioning anchors" section. Event 43 merged via PR #3. Event 44 merged via PR #4 (post-rebase).
> - **Event 45 (clone.yml + drift cleanup).** Cron `0 */24 * * *` (midnight UTC, most-contested dispatcher slot; zero scheduled runs fired in 20+ hours) → `7 3 * * *` (03:07 UTC, off-peak explicit single value). `actions/checkout@v2` → `@v4` (v2 runtime Node.js 16 removed from GitHub runners 2026-09-16). Plus Resume-here rewrite to clear stale Day-2 pivot content. Merged via PR #5 (2026-04-24).
> - **Event 46 (POST_SOAK_TRIAGE.md).** New 483-line governance artifact codifying the 4-phase GA decision protocol. Merged via PR #6 (2026-04-24).
> - **Event 47 (pre-soak-close grading infra).** Three Python tools in new `tools/` directory + four new docs. Rubric becomes executable at Day 7. CP-DISC-01 + CP-PHASE12-01 resolved. CP-TEL-01 + CP-FENCE-01 + CP-DEDUP-01 (new) root-caused with prepared patches; deferred. Phase 2 re-scoped: 1,294 → 40 unique findings (32× ratio). Merged via PR #7 (2026-04-24).
> - **Event 48 (audit execution + corrections).** Ran `episteme profile audit --write`; Phase 12 detected drift on `asymmetry_posture` axis. **Gate 25 moved FAIL → PASS.** Grader schema fix + 2 Phase 2 classification corrections. Zero hook/kernel/schema commits. Opened PR #8.
> - **Event 49 (Path Y mid-soak hook fix).** Applied CP-TEL-01 (exit_code extraction — Claude Code uses `returnCodeInterpretation`/`interrupted`, not `isError`) + CP-DEDUP-01 (pre-write tail-scan-200 dedup) + CP-FENCE-01 orphan cleanup (88 markers retired) + `tools/gate28_preaudit.py` (Gate 28 verdict PARTIAL not HARD BLOCK). 11 new regression tests. Merged via PR #9.
> - **Event 50 (CP-FENCE-02).** Operator authorized "Option B" for completeness. Fixed PreToolUse/PostToolUse correlation-id mismatch via dual-write + fallback-read strategy. 3 new regression tests; 600/600 total passing. First real fence_reconstruction op during remaining soak materializes `protocols.jsonl` and lifts Gate 26 FAIL → PASS. Merged via PR #10.
> - **Event 51 (Post-v1.0 Roadmap + Hermes lessons).** `docs/ROADMAP_POST_V1.md` (484 lines) consolidates scattered post-soak scope into a branched roadmap: governing intent anchor + 3 Day-7 scenario branches + 5 milestone themes + TUI observability stream + v2.0 cross-project candidate, with dependency graph + explicit non-goals per milestone. Hermes Agent v2026.4.23 lessons appendix identifies what to adopt (Textual TUI, `/steer`-as-`episteme guide --inject`, subagent spawn overlay) vs consciously decline. Merged via PR #11.
> - **Event 52 (Langfuse v3.170.0 adjacent-ecosystem appendix).** Extended ROADMAP §5 with Langfuse adopt/decline analysis (§5.5-§5.10). Key counter-positioning: **Langfuse and episteme are vertically composable, not horizontally competitive** — Langfuse sees LLM-call shape, episteme sees reasoning shape around the call; CP-OTEL-01 makes the federation explicit. Merged via PR #12.
> - **Event 53 (this PR — roadmap audit).** Audit pass on every item imported from Hermes/Langfuse against the kernel mandate. **REMOVED** CP-DISC-03 (LLM-as-judge in measurement apparatus reintroduces the confident-wrongness failure mode the kernel exists to detect) + CP-WEB-01 (web dashboard parity contradicted our own "analytics-dashboard-as-primary-product" non-adopt). **DOWNGRADED** CP-TUI-02 to v1.2-optional. **TIGHTENED** CP-OTEL-01 with explicit export-only / no-consumer-UI scope discipline. **REMOVED** the vague "plugin surface patterns study" from Hermes adopt (violated positive-system rule — no CP id / no effort / no acceptance). Added **§7 Audit log** documenting removals with rationale + cadence rule ("if future audits remove ≤ 25% of prior scan's adopts, scan methodology is over-permissive"). Event 53 removed-or-tightened 2 of Event 52's 3 adopts = 66% adjustment ratio; discipline is working.
>
> **PR queue at session close (2026-04-24).** PR #2 — `chore(master): release episteme 1.1.0-rc1` (release-please auto-gen) — **HELD open intentionally** per operator decision to defer the next release tag until post-soak when the "big improvement" batch (v1.0.1 Chain Hygiene CP: Stop-hook-async maintenance worker + zero-LLM entity extraction + deferred-discoveries dedup + resolution-record type) is ready to bundle. release-please auto-updates PR #2 on each master push; no action needed until post-soak. PRs #5-12 (Events 45-52) all merged 2026-04-24. PR #13 — Event 53 — opened by this commit; awaits operator review + merge.
>
> **Operator availability note.** Operator is busy 2026-04-29 → early May. Soak extension to ~2026-05-07 or later is acceptable; the clock doesn't need to close on 2026-04-30.
>
> **Soak posture (binding until operator ends soak).**
> - **DO NOT start Phase B** (behavior-changing `default_autonomy_class` / `fence_check_strictness` / Ashby escalate-by-default / MCP proxy daemon). These are v1.0.1 post-soak work.
> - **DO NOT edit `core/hooks/` or `kernel/*`** except (a) Path-A-class exceptions if another pipeline-breakage surfaces, or (b) operator-authorized targeted hotfixes (like the Event 42 root-path canonicalization which was explicitly pulled forward).
> - **OK to ship** soak-safe distribution / web / docs / CI work as Event-numbered PRs. External-tester hotfixes land via the same pattern.
> - **DO NOT** merge PR #2 during soak — wait for the v1.0.1 batch to clarify the right version-bump direction.
>
> **Gate-grading at soak close.** **Run `docs/POST_SOAK_TRIAGE.md` Phase 1-4 end-to-end** — the legacy "sample 50+ episodic records and score ≥ 4/8" criterion is superseded by the explicit PASS/PARTIAL/FAIL rubric in that document (Gate 28 is now a hard block; PARTIAL counts as 0.5 of a PASS for the 4.0 threshold). Next-session agent that reads this should confirm pipeline still healthy (`wc -l ~/.episteme/state/hooks.log`, `ls ~/.episteme/memory/episodic/`) before trusting the soak clock.

Gate 26 flips FAIL → PASS/PARTIAL on the first fence_reconstruction op that fires with exit_code == 0 during remaining ~6 days of soak (organic — every constraint-removal triggers the blueprint). Gates 22, 23, 24, 28 are MANUAL at grading — their infrastructure blockers are resolved; they now just need operator judgment during the grading session. Gate 28 pre-audit reports PARTIAL (not HARD BLOCK). **Weighted pass projection: 4.0-5.5 → GA candidate strong.**

### Day-2 Gate Grading — HISTORICAL · resolved via Path A (Events 36-38)

> **This section records the evidence that drove the Path A pipeline-reset decision on 2026-04-23.** Path A subsequently completed; pipeline is verified healthy as of Event 38. Content preserved for audit trail; operator + future agents should NOT read this section as describing the current state.
>
> *(original Day-2 summary retained below for historical completeness)*

**Summary.** 1 clear-pass · 1 clear-fail · 6 ungradeable-broken-evidence-pipeline. **GA threshold of ≥ 4 / 8 clear-pass cannot be reached on current data**, but for a **mechanical measurement reason, not a cognitive-quality reason** — the episodic writer is not producing records, and the Pillar 3 protocol stream is empty. The soak-safety posture ("don't edit `core/hooks/`") was conditional on the evidence pipeline working; that condition no longer holds. **Operator decision required** — path A: fix pipeline (breaks soak, restart with fresh timer), or path B: ship v1.0 with honestly-named cognitive-adoption gap and treat fix as v1.0.1 pre-requisite.

**Critical pipeline finding.** `~/.episteme/memory/episodic/` contains only ONE record — a pre-tag smoke test at `/tmp/ep_smoke` from 2026-04-20T15:56. Since the v1.0.0-rc1 tag landed 2026-04-22, there have been:

- 4,469 audit records (`~/.episteme/audit.jsonl` post-2026-04-22)
- 5,320 `git push` firings · 564 `cascade:architectural` firings · 372 `fence:constraint-removal` firings (across full 7227-record log)
- 600 records targeting `/Users/junlee/episteme` directly (kernel-dogfood proof)
- **0 new episodic records produced by `core/hooks/episodic_writer.py`** despite correct wiring in `hooks/hooks.json` (PostToolUse · Bash matcher · async) and high-impact patterns that should match `git push`, `cascade:architectural`, etc. Writer has `except Exception: pass` on failures so silent-failure mode is consistent with observed zero-writes. Probable causes: silent path misconfiguration, `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}` env unset at runtime, or an uncaught exception before record-append. **NOT diagnosed further this session — diagnosis requires editing `core/hooks/` which is soak-frozen.**

**Per-gate verdict.**

| Gate | Criterion | Verdict | Evidence |
|---|---|---|---|
| 21 | Sample 20 episodic records → 0 lazy placeholders, substantive unknowns, falsifiable disconfirmations | **ungradeable** | Only 1 total episodic record; 0 post-tag. Sample size insufficient by mechanical failure of evidence pipeline, not by absence of real decisions. |
| 22 | ≥ 1 disconfirmation fires AND downstream action changes | **ungradeable** | `~/.episteme/framework/protocols.jsonl` does not exist. 372 fence:constraint-removal firings in audit log but zero synthesized protocols on disk — synthesis emit path also silent. Cannot distinguish "no successful rollback-free fence" from "synthesis writer broken." |
| 23 | Sample 10 surfaces — < 10% preferences-filed-as-knowns or inferences-filed-as-facts | **ungradeable** | `.episteme/reasoning-surface.json` is overwritten each op; episodic tier would have snapshotted history but is broken. Current (single) surface inspected: 8 knowns verified-specific, 4 unknowns sharp (> 50 chars each), assumptions flagged correctly — but N=1 is not statistically meaningful. |
| 24 | Pick 5 hypothesis-bearing surfaces; trace forward for validated/refined/invalidated marker; ≥ 3 of 5 explicit update | **ungradeable** | No forward-trace possible without episodic snapshots. Current surface has a hypothesis field; no downstream record to trace to. |
| 25 | Profile-audit loop surfaces ≥ 1 real drift detection | **ungradeable** | Phase 12 audit output location not confirmed. `state/last_session.json` is just session TS. No visible drift-detection artifact. Requires hook-trace to confirm if writer is silent or just not visible. |
| 26 | Semantic-tier proposals encode reasoning-shape regularity (≥ 1) | **ungradeable** | Semantic tier not observable. 0.11.0 promotion job exists per PLAN.md but no output directory found under `~/.episteme/memory/`. |
| 27 | Episodic records cite ≥ 3 distinct FAILURE_MODES.md ids (WYSIATI / question-substitution / anchoring / narrative-fallacy / planning-fallacy / overconfidence / etc.) | **clear-fail** | Searched all 1,208 deferred_discoveries records + current reasoning-surface for the 9 canonical FAILURE_MODES.md terms: **0 citations**. The kernel has two coexisting vocabularies — Blueprint-D `flaw_classification` enum (used in reasoning-surfaces: 666 schema-implementation-drift / 234 config-gap / 184 other / 117 doc-code-drift) AND FAILURE_MODES.md taxonomy (WYSIATI, question-substitution, etc.). Gate 27 tests the latter; only the former appears in real work. **Real cognitive finding** — independent of pipeline breakage. |
| 28 | Kernel-on-itself dogfood — Blueprint D fires on episteme-editing-episteme without bypass | **clear-pass** | 564 `cascade:architectural` firings in audit log; 600 records against `/Users/junlee/episteme`; Blueprint D hit this session ≥ 4× in the operator's own terminal; strict-mode enforced throughout (no `touch .episteme/advisory-surface` bypass used); 3,675 blocked actions total across audit stream. Rich positive evidence. |

**So-What for Operator.**

1. Gate 28 alone is clear-pass, which proves the enforcement arm works on the kernel itself. That's a real (though narrow) v1.0 GA positive claim.
2. Gate 27 is a CLEAR COGNITIVE finding — the FAILURE_MODES.md taxonomy is **decorative**, not load-bearing, in actual work. This is what Gate 27 was designed to detect and it detected it honestly. Fix: either demote the taxonomy from load-bearing claim (update kernel/FAILURE_MODES.md + CONSTITUTION.md framing), or engineer a mechanism that surfaces the 9 failure-mode ids into blueprint firings (e.g., WYSIATI auto-cited whenever `unknowns: []` almost-blocked the surface).
3. Gates 21-26 are blocked by the evidence pipeline breakage. Gate-grading is **literally unperformable** until `episodic_writer.py` produces records.

**Options for the operator:**

- **Path A — Fix pipeline, restart soak with fresh timer.** Break soak (intentional, justified): edit `core/hooks/episodic_writer.py` to add diagnostic stderr on the failure path so silent failure mode becomes loud; once writing is verified, open Day 1 of a fresh 7-day soak. Total delay: ~1 day for diagnosis + fix + verify, plus fresh 7-day window = ~8 days total from now. Honest path; preserves the cognitive-gate framework's measurement validity.
- **Path B — Ship v1.0 with honest scope.** Ship v1.0.0 GA with: (a) engineering gates pass, (b) Gate 28 clear-pass (kernel-dogfood proven), (c) Gates 21-26 *"deferred to v1.0.1 pending evidence-pipeline fix,"* (d) Gate 27 clear-fail acknowledged (taxonomy needs demotion or mechanism). Downside: shipping without proof of the product's cognitive thesis. Dogfood failure — Gate 28 exists to catch exactly this compromise.
- **Path C — Extend soak, keep digging.** Continue soak-safe work (Events 34, 35, etc.) while investigating the pipeline via stderr-capture on a test session. Same-day diagnosis possible if `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` is the issue. If fixable without editing `core/hooks/` (e.g., by setting env correctly at Claude Code invocation), pipeline restores without breaking soak. Lowest risk, slowest path.

**Recommended: Path A.** The Gate 28 + Gate 27 evidence is honest. But shipping v1.0 with 6 of 8 cognitive gates ungradeable is exactly the confident-wrongness the kernel exists to counter. Restart the soak clock is a 1-week cost for a defensible v1.0.0 GA claim. Session-level Blueprint D firing on the episodic-writer fix itself becomes the repair's own dogfood proof.

**NOT yet recorded / deferred until operator decision:** Events 34 (Korean README) + 35 (release-please) queue is still open. Steps 3 (CP update to event-driven), 4 (README.ko.md + /readme/ko), 5 (release-please) are all still soak-safe regardless of which path the operator picks — they can proceed in parallel with any of Paths A/B/C. Pushed today (chronological): `ad78979` (auto-chkpt /readme + deps), `cdd548c` (Event 29 Header anchor-tab fix + docs), `b0c166c` (Event 30 — issue #1 follow-up: `plugin.json` `hooks` field removed, resolves duplicate-load install failure), `fe5088e` (Event 31 — `/commands` route auto-renders `docs/COMMANDS.md` as narrow single-file exception to Event 29's `docs/*.md`-class rejection), `b995be0` (memory promotion — `core/memory/global/agent_feedback.md` seeded with no-AI-trailers + kernel-tone-discipline, wired into `episteme sync`), `d326126` (memory rule-shape rule appended — positive-vs-negative-system awareness, causal root quoted from operator's 7th-grade US-move monologue with his father), `0405495` (Event 32 — README blockquote + web Hero softened; `high-impact command` broadened to `high-impact move — the task, not just the shell command`, agent-validates-request clause added, governance surface untouched), `4c59d87` (Event 33 — `epistemekernel.com` custom domain live: GoDaddy→Vercel DNS wired with www-primary + apex 308→www, layout `metadataBase` + OG/Twitter cards point at `https://www.epistemekernel.com`, README header gets centered domain link). **Next session picks up mid-soak, Day 2 of 7.** Daily soak posture applies: accept external-tester hotfixes (Event 27/30 pattern), further marketing/web/docs polish OK, do not touch `core/hooks/` or `kernel/*`, do not start Phase B. At soak close (~2026-04-29): sample 20+ episodic records from `~/.episteme/memory/episodic/`, score cognitive-adoption gates 21–28, open v1.0 GA window if ≥ 4 of 8 pass.

**State.** v0.11.0 has been tagged and shipped. The v1.0 RC cycle is open. The approved spec is `docs/DESIGN_V1_0_SEMANTIC_GOVERNANCE.md` — titled *Design — Causal-Consequence Scaffolding & Protocol Synthesis — v1.0 RC*, status `approved (reframed, third pass)`. Three successive reframes on 2026-04-21 re-anchored the spec:

- **First pass** — from "semantic governance / anti-vapor defense" to "structural forcing function for causal-consequence modeling." Added Pillar 1 (Cognitive Blueprints) + Pillar 2 (Append-Only Hash Chain); absorbed BYOS.
- **Second pass** — added Pillar 3 (Framework Synthesis & Active Guidance); renamed subtitle to *Causal-Consequence Scaffolding & Protocol Synthesis*; CP plan 8 → 9.
- **Third pass** — enshrined the **ultimate why** in the preamble (information overload → context-fit protocol extraction → living thinking framework → active guidance → continuous self-maintenance). Promoted the prior "Blueprint D · Unclassified High-Impact (catchall)" to a load-bearing **Blueprint D · Architectural Cascade & Escalation** (patch-vs-refactor evaluation, symmetric cascade synchronization, continuous digging & logging). Goodhart closer for blueprint-absence preserved as a **generic maximum-rigor fallback** (Consequence-Chain-shaped), not a blueprint. CP plan 9 → 10 (CP10 = Blueprint D scaffolding + cascade detector + deferred-discovery hash-chained write).

**Next action (fresh session):** **v1.0.0-rc1 tagged and deployed (2026-04-22, Event 25).** The tag landed on HEAD `93b9658`, first Vercel production deploy went live (fixtures-mode safe default), and the 7-day RC soak opened against the tagged commit for cognitive-adoption gates 21-28 measurement. **Phase A of v1.0.1 audit close-out shipped immediately (4 commits `b603685` / `eccae8b` / `a8d83d6` / `e66abe9`)** — advisory-only surfaces closing 3 of 5 orphan derived-knob gaps plus 2 docs gaps from the REFERENCES.md audit, all soak-safe (zero exit-code impact). Tests: 587/587 green (565 baseline + 22 new) + 21 subtests. The RC cycle moves to **soak-window verification** per spec § Verification — no further CPs before v1.0.1, and no behavior-changing hook edits until soak closes.

**Immediate next session work (any of, priority order):**

1. **`v1.0.0-rc1` tagged + Vercel deployed — shipped 2026-04-22, Event 25.** Tag on HEAD `93b9658`. First Vercel production deploy went live (fixtures-mode safe default, no env-var configuration required). All engineering gates passed: 576-then-587/587 tests green, `episteme kernel verify` clean, `episteme doctor` green on macOS. **The 7-day RC soak window is now open against the tagged commit.**
2. **RC soak opens** — engineering gates are necessary-and-insufficient per spec. Cognitive-adoption gates 21–28 (Reasoning-quality signal / disconfirmation fires / facts-inferences-preferences separation / hypothesis-test-update cycle / Phase 12 drift catches / semantic-tier reasoning-shape / failure-mode taxonomy citations / kernel-on-itself dogfood) measured across ≥ 7 days of real use.
3. **First real Fence synthesis** — during soak, expect the first successful constraint-removal op to produce the first hash-chained framework protocol; CP9's `episteme guide` then surfaces it on a matching future context. Zero protocols exist on disk today; first one during soak is the v1.0 RC Verification-#1b gate proof.
4. **Phase A of v1.0.1 audit close-out — shipped 2026-04-22, Event 25 (4 commits).** Pre-soak audit of `kernel/REFERENCES.md` vs code + `core/memory/global/cognitive_profile.md` vs hook consumers found 4 declared-only reference gaps (Ashby / Munger / Jaynes / Pearl) plus 5 orphan derived knobs (only 2 of 7 consumed by hooks). Phase A closed the purely-advisory subset:
   - `b603685` `docs(kernel)` — Pearl honest-translation note in REFERENCES.md (pattern-match-via-cascade-detector is the RC proxy for Level-3 counterfactual, not direct causal-graph construction).
   - `eccae8b` `docs(progress)` — Event 25 records the tag + deploy + soak-open + Phase A scope rules.
   - `a8d83d6` `feat(hooks)` — SessionStart `_noise_watch_line()` producer consumes `noise_watch_set` knob + 11 new tests.
   - `e66abe9` `feat(hooks)` — Frame-stage `_advisory_footer()` consumes `preferred_lens_order` + `explanation_form` + 11 new tests.
   All four commits are advisory-only (zero exit-code impact); the soak against `v1.0.0-rc1` stays valid. Post-Phase-A knob-consumption: 5 of 7 (was 2 of 7).
5. **Phase B — post-soak v1.0.1 work (DO NOT START DURING SOAK — explicit decision, see § "Hybrid-C decision record" below).** Behavior-changing closure of the remaining orphan-knob gaps + the Ashby escalate-by-default gap from the REFERENCES.md audit:
   - Wire `default_autonomy_class` into `block_dangerous.py` or a new PreToolUse escalation shim (derives from `risk_tolerance` + `asymmetry_posture`; changes irreversible-op gating behavior).
   - Wire `fence_check_strictness` into Blueprint B `_fence_synthesis.py` / `_layer_fence_validate` thresholds (derives from `cognitive.fence_discipline`).
   - Ashby escalate-by-default prototype — new PreToolUse hook shim, narrow start on network egress, closes `FAILURE_MODE 9` (controller-variety mismatch). Per existing NEXT_STEPS item 14 in § "Fix during RC cycle."
   - MCP proxy daemon — closes intra-call write-then-execute (bypass vector #1). Medium-term, may land in Phase B or a separate v1.1 arc depending on implementation cost.

   **Phase B audit-cleanup rider (soak-safe, non-behavior-changing; bundles with the Phase B commit series — see 2026-04-22 post-Phase-A audit session).** All items are prose-only or citation-only — zero exit-code impact, zero episodic-record-shape change. Lands as companion commits to Phase B's behavior-changing ones, not before.

   - **Tone-coherence pass (1 residual + 1 mixed).** `docs/HOOKS.md` title + lede ("Deterministic Safety Hooks") is pre-v1.0-RC umbrella terminology that lagged the "structural forcing function for causal-consequence modeling" reframing; candidate rename: "Deterministic Kernel Hooks" / "Deterministic Posture Hooks." `adapters/claude/README.md` aligns its "safety hooks" label to the chosen term (3 occurrences: lines 3, 22, 31). All other security-flavored text in the repo is either load-bearing (FAILURE_MODES, KERNEL_LIMITS bypass-vector accounting, the reframing narrative at this file line 11 and DESIGN_V1_0_SEMANTIC_GOVERNANCE.md line 7, Phase B behavior-changing item language) or historical-record not-applicable (PROGRESS.md, CHANGELOG.md, PLAN.md, DESIGN_V0_11_PHASE_12.md).

   - **REFERENCES.md permeation fixes + Phase A classification correction.** Phase A audit (line 22 above) classified Ashby / Munger / Jaynes / Pearl as declared-only. Post-audit: **Munger is strongly permeated** — 8+ body-text citations across CONSTITUTION.md, REASONING_SURFACE.md, OPERATOR_PROFILE_SCHEMA.md, COGNITIVE_SYSTEM_PLAYBOOK.md, AGENTS.md, DESIGN_V1_0_SEMANTIC_GOVERNANCE.md, demos/, and core/memory/global/cognitive_profile.md; tied to the `preferred_lens_order` knob — so Munger is not a permeation gap. Pearl was closed by Phase A commit `b603685`. Ashby and Jaynes/Laplace are partial (body-cited, mechanism deferred — Ashby to Phase B, Jaynes schema to Phase C). The actual declared-only set is: **Feynman**, **Festinger** (both added 0.11-entry; zero body-text citations outside REFERENCES.md), **Gall** (likely declared-only pending secondary-grep confirmation during rider work), and **Tetlock inverse-partial** (calibration telemetry + friction analyzer mechanisms ship per 0.10.0, but no body doc cites Tetlock by name). Close by: one body-text citation apiece in the mechanism-adjacent surface — Feynman in `kernel/CONSTITUTION.md` Principle I adjacency; Festinger in `kernel/FAILURE_MODES.md` mode 6 (confidence exceeding accuracy) adjacency; Gall in `kernel/README.md` or `docs/EVOLUTION_CONTRACT.md` incremental-posture section; Tetlock in `docs/HOOKS.md` calibration-telemetry row or `docs/SETUP.md` telemetry section.

   - **Candidate additional primary sources to evaluate during the permeation pass** (load-bearing test per `kernel/REFERENCES.md` § Attribution maintenance — removing the concept must collapse a principle or artifact's operational shape; none are foregone):
     - **Amos Tversky** — explicit co-citation inside the Kahneman entry; current attribution shortchanges Tversky's collaboration role on the heuristics-and-biases work the kernel builds on.
     - **Gerd Gigerenzer — *Gut Feelings* / *Risk Savvy*** — ecological rationality / fast-and-frugal heuristics; complements Klein on "System-1 is often right within its ecological niche" and gives a stronger empirical anchor for honest handling of `tacit_call`.
     - **David Marr — *Vision* (1982)** — three levels of analysis (computational / algorithmic / implementational); maps onto the kernel-truth-vs-implementation-vs-runtime hierarchy (kernel/*.md = computational; hook scripts = algorithmic; runtime interception = implementational). Load-bearing only if the architecture docs cite the hierarchy explicitly.
     - **Frederic Bartlett — *Remembering* (1932)** — reconstructive memory; grounds `kernel/MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md`'s episodic-as-evidence-not-storage posture in a primary source rather than letting it read as a design assertion.
     - **Stafford Beer — Viable System Model** — adjacent to Ashby but distinct (Beer on recursive regulator structure, Ashby on variety matching); secondary at minimum, promote to primary only if the governance-layer architecture section extends to recursive-regulator framing.
     - **Donald Schön / John Dewey — promotion from secondary to primary** — if the reflective tier in `kernel/MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md` is genuinely reflective-practice-informed rather than "metacognition-by-analogy," their current secondary classification understates the load-bearing role.

   - **Kernel-dogfood schema gaps surfaced this audit session (v1.0.1+ schema-evolution candidates, not blocking).** Five Blueprint-D schema observations that forced vocabulary substitution or implicit-tier-up on a read-only-turned-single-file-edit session:
     1. `flaw_classification` enum lacks a "doc-positioning-drift" / "cross-doc framing drift" class — forced to `other`.
     2. `posture_selected` enum lacks "audit-first" / "scout-then-decide" — forced to `patch`.
     3. `blast_radius_map[].status` enum lacks "read-for-audit" — used `not-applicable` with custom `audit_mode` sidecar field.
     4. Scenario detector fires `cascade:architectural` (Blueprint D) on `find` / `ls` / filesystem-enumeration Bash ops even when the op mutates nothing; Blueprint D should have a "read-only scan" scenario variant that skips the `sync_plan` requirement (no surfaces are being synced). Current behavior is correct-but-expensive — costs multiple surface-update tool calls for mutation-free ops.
     5. `deferred_discoveries[]` validator tiers up from "string-allowed" (low-stakes read-only ops) to "dict-with-description+class+observable+log_only_rationale required" (any op with a `needs_update` entry in `blast_radius_map`) — this implicit tier-up is not documented in the schema doc; surface as v1.0.1 schema-doc entry.

     Each is a schema-evolution candidate, not a blocking issue. Log as Blueprint D deferred-discovery entries during Phase B execution for post-soak triage into v1.0.1+ schema work.

6. **Phase C — v1.1+ schema evolution (post-soak evidence-driven).** Jaynes/Laplace evidence-weighted assumption update — add posterior plausibility field to the `memory-contract` schema, migrate episodic/reflective writers. Gated on soak evidence that boolean assumptions are losing information (sampling ≥ 20 episodic records and finding ≥ 3 cases where an assumption "flipped to known" lost information about remaining uncertainty).

### Hybrid-C decision record (2026-04-22, post-push)

Operator asked whether to start Phase B immediately (skip soak) or wait. Reviewed 6 remaining gaps (5 orphan-knob consumers + Ashby escalate-by-default + SUMMARY Blueprint D mention + MCP daemon + Jaynes schema) against soak-corruption risk:

- **4 of 6 corrupt the soak** — `default_autonomy_class`, `fence_check_strictness`, Ashby escalate-by-default, Jaynes schema all change episodic-record shape or block distribution. Wiring any of them mid-soak means the Verification-#1b gate proof gets conflated pre-vs-post; cognitive-adoption gates 21–28 cannot compare against the tagged RC state.
- **1 is soak-safe and shipped today** — Kernel SUMMARY Blueprint D mention (Event 17 DD #3 carry-forward). Surgical: added modes 10+11 to the failure-modes table, added a three-pillars paragraph naming Axiomatic Judgment · Fence Reconstruction · Consequence Chain · Blueprint D · generic fallback. Zero code change. Manifest regen'd. Commit SHA: `<post-commit>`.
- **1 is implementation-dependent** — MCP proxy daemon. Deferred to Phase B with a judgment call at that point.

**Decision: Hybrid Option C.** Ship item 5 now; freeze items 1–4 + 6 until soak closes. Named alternatives considered:
- *Option A (strict wait).* Nothing moves until day 7. Rejected as unnecessarily idle; item 5 had zero soak impact.
- *Option B (do all 6 now).* Rejected. Would require honestly downgrading the release narrative to "engineering gates only; cognitive gates deferred to v1.0.1." The product's thesis is a structural forcing function against confident wrongness; skipping its own forcing function on launch day is the dogfood failure gate 28 exists to catch.

**Soak target close: ~2026-04-29.** At that mark, score cognitive-adoption gates 21–28 against real-use episodic records (manual sampling per NEXT_STEPS § "Verification for RC gate — cognitive adoption"). If ≥ 4 of 8 pass, v1.0 GA window opens and Phase B can resume. If < 4 pass, extend soak or reopen gaps as v1.0.1 known-gaps honestly.

**If a future agent session reads this before ~2026-04-29:** the answer to "can I start Phase B now" is **no** regardless of framing. The only item safe to touch is Phase C-adjacent schema work that doesn't land in the hot path, OR purely-non-kernel work (web dashboard, demo polish, docs). If unsure, ask the operator before touching any file in `core/hooks/` or `core/blueprints/`.
7. **v1.0.1 follow-ups already logged as deferred discoveries (CP10 surface):** kernel-state-file exemption allowlist widening if post-soak shows more `.episteme/` state files need shielding; per-file cross-ref counting if Trigger 3 FPs accumulate; retrospective sync-plan orphan-reference verification; `kernel/SUMMARY.md` Blueprint D mention update.

8. **v1.0.1 · Chain Hygiene & Self-Maintenance CP — event-driven Stop-hook async worker · dedup · resolution-records · zero-LLM entity extraction (post-soak; `core/hooks/` + framework-chain schema; queued 2026-04-23, updated 2026-04-23 to event-driven architecture).** **POST-SOAK ONLY** — but note that Path-A soak reset (see § "Day-2 Gate Grading" above) changed the dependency: this CP now follows the pipeline hotfix (Events 36 + 37 this session) and the fresh-soak close, not the original 2026-04-29 target. Queued because the session surfaced that `~/.episteme/framework/deferred_discoveries.jsonl` holds **1,201 records but only 32 unique descriptions** (first-80-char match); top 4 descriptions are each duplicated exactly **105 times**, with a 5th at 82 — a systematic re-logging signature, not scattered re-discovery. Four distinct gaps, unified under one event-driven maintenance worker:

   - **Gap 1 · Write-side dedup missing.** When a reasoning-surface's `deferred_discoveries[]` array writes to the chain (via Blueprint D validator → `_chain.append`), no check runs against already-chained content. Every Blueprint D firing whose source surface carries a persisted discovery entry appends the full array verbatim. Fix shape: content-hash dedup on append. Hash `payload.description + payload.flaw_classification + payload.observable` → skip append if match found within a recency window (N=30 days candidate; cheap O(n) scan on the chain tail). Preserves Pillar 2 append-only — dedup is a write-time admission check, not a post-hoc chain mutation.

   - **Gap 2 · No resolution-record type.** Hash chain is append-only by design (Pillar 2), so `payload.status: "pending"` on a prior entry never flips to `resolved` in-place. Nothing in the current schema says "entry X was closed by work Y." Fix shape: new chain payload type `deferred_discovery_resolution` carrying: `resolves_entry_hash` (target entry's `entry_hash`), `resolver_commit_sha` (git SHA of the commit that closed it), `resolution_verdict` (enum: `fixed` / `superseded` / `wont-fix` / `cannot-reproduce`), `resolver_rationale` (one-paragraph why), `logged_at` (ISO-8601). Chain verification extended to cross-reference — if a `deferred_discovery` entry has a subsequent `deferred_discovery_resolution` entry that references its hash, the pending-count query filters it out. `episteme guide --deferred` + SessionStart hook digest both gain `unresolved_only` semantics.

   - **Gap 3 · No self-maintenance loop (NEW — architecture revised from cron to event-driven).** Episteme has no off-hot-path cadence for consolidation work. gbrain's architecture (21 cron jobs for memory consolidation, citation fixes, entity enrichment) was the obvious inspiration, but claude-mem's event-driven alternative is a cleaner fit: **use the existing kernel `Stop` hook** (PostToolUse Session-end, already wired in `hooks/hooks.json`) to trigger an async maintenance worker. No cron infrastructure needed; no polling waste; latency matches the actual write cadence. Fix shape: new `core/hooks/session_maintenance.py` that runs async on `Stop`; idempotent; short TTL (30-60 seconds budgeted per session-end). Responsibilities: (a) run Gap 1's dedup backscan over the current session's appends; (b) detect obvious-closure deferred discoveries (commit SHA lineage indicates a referenced concern has been resolved — e.g., description mentions `kernel/SUMMARY.md` and a later commit touched that file) → auto-file a `deferred_discovery_resolution` record with verdict `fixed` and the resolving commit SHA; (c) prune side-indexes; (d) emit a structured session-summary record for the reflective tier.

   - **Gap 4 · Zero-LLM entity extraction (NEW — bundled into the maintenance worker).** gbrain's main architectural insight: extract typed entity relationships from every page write using regex + heuristic cascades, **zero LLM calls on the write path**. Episteme's Pillar 3 context-signature algorithm is currently "regex + entity hashing" (per `docs/DESIGN_V1_0_SEMANTIC_GOVERNANCE.md` Pillar 3); this is the same family but primitive. Port gbrain's pattern: on every reasoning-surface write, run a lightweight extractor that names entities (`tool:<name>`, `dir:<path>`, `error:<type>`, `concept:<term>`, `commit:<sha>`) and typed relations (`fires-on`, `resolves`, `blocks`, `supersedes`, `dogfoods`). Store as a side-index keyed to surface hash. The maintenance worker (Gap 3) consolidates these into a framework graph that the `episteme guide` query uses to prefer high-overlap protocols. Expected effect: Pillar 3 `guide --context` precision jumps measurably (benchmark target — see Gate 27 follow-up below — `Recall@5` on synthetic test corpus, mirror of gbrain's Recall@5 discipline).

   **Verification acceptance criteria (post-fix triage pass):**

   - Run the same count-by-unique-description one-liner used on 2026-04-23 (see baseline below). Post-fix: record count grows ≤ O(1) per new distinct concern per session, not O(N_firings) per concern per session.
   - Triage the 32 existing unique descriptions in `~/.episteme/framework/deferred_discoveries.jsonl` against completed work. At minimum: the 3 duplicates-at-105 descriptions that are substantially closed by Events 17 (kernel-state-file exemption) / 21 (kernel/SUMMARY.md Blueprint D mention) get `deferred_discovery_resolution` records with `resolution_verdict: fixed` + commit-SHA references.
   - SessionStart hook digest at top of a fresh session reads `N unique deferred discoveries pending` where N < 10 (vs. current raw 1,131).
   - Gate 57 (PLAN.md line 57 — *"≥ 3 deferred-discovery entries logged; ≥ 1 either promoted to a named phase/CP or triaged to won't-fix with rationale"*) is genuinely satisfied. Before this CP, the *"≥ 1 promoted"* half is literally unimplementable on the chain because no promotion-record schema exists. This CP closes that implementability gap.
   - Stop-hook maintenance worker completes in < 60 seconds on p95 session-end (not load-bearing on Claude Code responsiveness since `async: true`; upper budget to prevent runaway).
   - Pillar 3 guide-precision benchmark (new, gbrain-inspired): synthesize 10-20 decision contexts with known matching protocols; measure Recall@5 and Precision@5 before-vs-after zero-LLM entity extraction. Target ≥ +10% Recall@5 for the CP to ship. If gains are flat, the entity-extraction scheme needs rethink before merge.

   **Scope bound (explicit, to prevent post-soak scope creep):**

   - **In scope.** Event-driven `core/hooks/session_maintenance.py` runs on `Stop`; write-side dedup in the deferred_discoveries write path (Gap 1); new `deferred_discoveries_resolution` chain payload type (Gap 2); `_chain.verify()` extension to cross-link resolution → target; `episteme guide --deferred` filter on unresolved-only; SessionStart digest filter; zero-LLM entity extractor + side-index (Gap 4); tests for dedup-on-append + resolution-record-append + pending-count-with-resolutions + entity-extraction coverage; one-time triage pass on the 32 existing unique descriptions in the live chain (file `deferred_discovery_resolution` records for the ones genuinely closed, mark the rest `wont-fix` or leave pending as intended); Pillar 3 precision benchmark harness.
   - **Out of scope.** Restructuring the `deferred_discoveries[]` field on the reasoning-surface schema itself (schema-evolution candidate for Phase C). Restructuring episodic or protocols streams (this CP is surgical to the deferred_discoveries stream + adds the maintenance-worker substrate; streams themselves stay intact). Backfill-resolving the full 1,201-record set — the triage targets the 32 unique descriptions only; historical duplicates stay in the chain as append-only history. LLM-backed entity extraction — explicitly NOT in scope (the whole point of Gap 4 is zero-LLM extraction).

   **Why this belongs in v1.0.1, not later.** Gate 57 is a named v1.0 RC Verification gate (PLAN.md line 57) and structurally unsatisfiable without resolution-record support. Post-fix, soak close (~2026-04-29) gains a concrete promotion / won't-fix triage mechanism instead of a log-only bookkeeping gesture. Delaying to v1.1 would ship v1.0 GA with a known-unsatisfiable gate, which is exactly the confident-wrongness failure mode the kernel's thesis exists to prevent.

   **Baseline snapshot (2026-04-23T19:11Z, for post-soak comparison):** 1,201 records; 32 unique descriptions (first-80-char match); top-5 duplicate counts 105 / 105 / 105 / 105 / 82; file size 1.4 MB. Reproduce via:

   ```bash
   python3 -c "import json, collections; c=collections.Counter()
   for line in open('/Users/junlee/.episteme/framework/deferred_discoveries.jsonl'):
       rec = json.loads(line)
       c[rec.get('payload',{}).get('description','')[:80]] += 1
   print(f'records:{sum(c.values())} unique:{len(c)}')
   print(c.most_common(5))"
   ```

5. **Visual coherence pass — shipped 2026-04-22, Event 21.** `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (Mermaid), `docs/assets/src/architecture_v2.dot` (Graphviz), and `docs/assets/system-overview.svg` (hand-authored) all rewritten to the v1.0 RC shipped state; SVGs regenerated; PNGs rasterized via `rsvg-convert` at 144 dpi; README.md stale "v1.0 RC, in flight" line flipped. Three pillars, four named blueprints, and the Blueprint D cascade detector now visible in all three diagrams. Archival v0.11 spec docs left as-is per historical-record discipline. Deferred: the TikZ/TeX sibling source; kernel SUMMARY Blueprint D mention (carried forward from Event 17 DD #3).

6. **Post-live asset audit + 2 MB cleanup — shipped 2026-04-22, Event 24.** Four files deleted: `architecture_v2.png` (628 KB) + `system-overview.png` (439 KB) — zero live embeds anywhere; SVGs at the same stems are the live link targets — and `strict_mode_demo.{cast,gif}` (~911 KB) — the only references were from non-reachable-from-README docs (`CONTRIBUTING.md`, `DEMOS.md`) which were rewritten to point at the Cognitive Cascade hero instead. Final `docs/assets/` is 4.2 MB, 93% of which is the one live `demo_posture.gif` hero embed. Every retained file has a named live reason or a deferred-sync entry.

7. **Post-deploy README hotfix — shipped 2026-04-22, Event 23.** `README.md` was pointing at the old `posture_demo.gif` filename; the new Cognitive Cascade GIF had landed as `demo_posture.gif` but nothing referenced it. Three cross-surface fixes (`README.md`, `docs/DEMOS.md`, `demos/03_differential/README.md`) all now point at `demo_posture.gif`. Three obsolete v0.11 assets deleted (`docs/assets/posture_demo.{cast,gif}` and the root-level `strict_demo.cast`). Rasterized PNGs kept pending a README hero decision.

7. **v1.0 GTM launch prep — shipped 2026-04-22, Event 22.** `scripts/demo_posture.sh` rewritten as the 4-act Cognitive Cascade (Fence Reconstruction → Architectural Cascade → Active Guidance), recorded by the operator to `docs/assets/demo_posture.{cast,gif}`; Event 17 DD #2 formally closed (no remaining `phase 12 pending` narration anywhere). `web/next.config.ts` hardened (reactStrictMode + poweredByHeader off + body-size limit). `web/README.md` rewritten as the deploy contract with Vercel Options A/B + full env-var matrix documenting the `NODE_ENV=production` + unset `EPISTEME_MODE` → `fixtures` safe default. Header layout fix: `AmbientStatus` gated `xl:flex` + compressed to 3 rows + `whitespace-nowrap`; nav ul gets `shrink-0` + reduced `lg:block` marketing links so the `dashboard →` button renders cleanly at every viewport ≥ `md`. **Ready to deploy.** The operator's next action is the first Vercel deploy; fixtures-mode default ensures a safe public first render even without env-var configuration.

7. **GTM site + dashboard ramp (`web/`, v1 shipped — 2026-04-22, Event 18; v2 shipped — 2026-04-22, Event 19; v1.1 polish shipped — 2026-04-22, Event 20).** Landing + dashboard + three API routes live-read `$EPISTEME_HOME/framework/*.jsonl` and `$EPISTEME_PROJECT/.episteme/reasoning-surface.json` via the envelope mapper; seven operator-console richness cues landed in v1.1 (atmospheric glow, gradient-lit borders, progressive blur, animated column-grid data streams, corner markers, live AmbientStatus chrome, word-mask hero reveal) without touching typography or narrative; `pnpm build` green at each step; smoke-tested against the kernel's own on-disk state. v2/post-v1.1 stages remaining:
   - **Deploy target + env plumbing.** Vercel is the candidate given Next 16. Before first public deploy: decide on fixtures-only static export (simplest) vs. server-mode with `EPISTEME_HOME` pointed at a committed snapshot directory (richer). `EPISTEME_MODE` defaults to `fixtures` in `NODE_ENV=production` per plan decision #1, so the default deploy is safe even without an explicit decision — but public content should be authored intentionally.
   - **Font-fetch resilience.** The Satoshi variable woff2 files are committed under `web/public/fonts/satoshi/` with FFL licenses, so CI does not need Fontshare network access.
   - **v3 live streaming.** SSE from an `episteme serve` daemon; the `useLiveResource` hook's SWR-lite shape (last-good data preserved during refetch) is the client contract; v3 swaps the interval-based fetch for an EventSource without touching component props. Deferred past v1.0 GA.
   - **Fixtures-only live sources (Telemetry + CascadeDetector).** Both still render static fixtures because the kernel does not persist a telemetry stream or a cascade-state snapshot to disk. Logged as Event 19 deferred discoveries #1 and #2 — requires kernel-side writer, post-v1.0 scope.

8. **Q1 — website auto-renders README content — shipped 2026-04-23, Event 29.** Approach (b) chosen and shipped. New `web/src/app/readme/page.tsx` server-component reads `README.md` via `fs.readFileSync` + `react-markdown` + `remark-gfm` + `rehype-raw` + `rehype-slug` + `rehype-autolink-headings` pipeline. Custom `rehypeRewriteRelativeUrls` plugin handles `src` / `href` / `srcSet` on raw-HTML elements (the README's `<picture><source srcSet>` block needs this since `urlTransform` only reaches standard markdown elements). README.md stays `.md` on disk — agent reads + GitHub homepage rendering both untouched. Internal doc links rewritten to GitHub blob URLs; image refs to GitHub raw URLs. Statically prerendered (467 KB HTML). Build green. Explicit posture decision recorded: keep `kernel/*.md` and `docs/*.md` rendering manual (audience mismatch + no current friction + GitHub renders them already). `/readme` itself logged for soak-window observation — delete in v1.0.1 if it earns no real use.

9. **Logo character mark — shipped 2026-04-22, Event 26 (candidate B · sage + summoned dragonling).** Composed mark+wordmark in deep indigo at `docs/assets/logo-{light,dark}.svg` (456×96 viewBox, replaces prior wordmark-only). Standalone character at `docs/assets/logo-mark-{light,dark}.svg` (96×96). Copies at `web/public/logo-*.svg`. README `<picture>` width bumped 360→456. `web/src/components/site/Header.tsx` replaced the `bg-chain` color-dot accent with the mark image at `size-7`. Candidates A and C deleted via `git rm -r docs/assets/logo-candidates/`; history preserves the non-picked directions. Follow-up status:
   - **`web/src/app/icon.svg` shipped** as App Router metadata-file SVG favicon (Event 26 commit `e403f5f`). Modern browsers prefer this over `favicon.ico`.
   - **`favicon.ico` regeneration — effectively N/A** post-Event 26. The existing `favicon.ico` remains as legacy-browser fallback; modern UAs pick up `icon.svg`. No action required unless legacy support becomes a soak-window concern.
   - **Header anchor-tab visual distinction — shipped 2026-04-23, Event 29.** `framework` / `surface` / `protocols` tabs now use a `↓` glyph (vs `→` on the `dashboard →` route button) to signal "scrolls on page" vs "navigates elsewhere." `href` values converted from `#X` to absolute `/#X` so the tabs work correctly from any page (previously broken from `/dashboard`, `/readme`, etc.).
   - **24×24 favicon visual test (operator-gated).** Operator to confirm the sage+dragonling silhouette reads as the intended archetype at favicon scale. If identity collapses, named fallback is a stripped-down C (dragon sigil alone).
   - **CLI half-block render** for `episteme init` banner: optional, ~14 cells wide, ANSI truecolor + Unicode `▀▄`. Truecolor required (iTerm2 / WezTerm / Kitty / Alacritty); plain-ASCII fallback for non-truecolor.

**CP10 has shipped — 565/565 tests passing, zero regressions; `_cascade_detector.py` (4 triggers + kernel-state exemption) + `_blueprint_d.py` (validator + deferred-discovery writer) + YAML populate + hot-path wiring + 36 new tests; Blueprint D self-dogfood gate passed LIVE inside the commit session; see `docs/PROGRESS.md` Event 17. Recent post-rebase commit SHAs: CP3 `101d3cd`, README GTM rewrite `23abc0a`, Event 10 doc-sync `636ad53`, CP4 `2558c67`, Event 11 doc-sync `b9bb1ee`, CP5 `117fa69`, CP6 `fb09b0a`, CP7 `086c10a`, CP8 `a1156c2`, CP9 `78c271f`; CP10 pending commit this session.**

**Tone-discipline boundary (codified 2026-04-21 at Event 10):** Plain-English / newcomer-friendly framing is a `README.md` + user-facing marketing discipline only. All files in `kernel/`, all files in `docs/DESIGN_*.md`, `docs/PLAN.md`, `docs/PROGRESS.md`, `docs/NEXT_STEPS.md`, `docs/COGNITIVE_SYSTEM_PLAYBOOK.md`, and `AGENTS.md` remain technical, precise, and rigorous by design — the technical vocabulary is load-bearing for controlling the LLM's posture and cannot be simplified inward without degrading the control signal. README cross-links into the technical surfaces; the technical surfaces do not bend inward to meet the README.

**CP4 bundle (committed `2558c67`):**

- `core/hooks/_grounding.py` (new, ~240 LOC) — regex entity extractor (snake_case / SCREAMING_CASE / path+ext / hex SHA with mandatory digit-AND-letter), project-grep grounding via `git ls-files` with `os.walk` fallback, in-process warm cache keyed on `(cwd, newest-tracked-mtime)`, FP-averse gate (reject only when grounded ≥ 2 AND not_found/named > 0.5), graceful degrade on IO exceptions.
- `core/hooks/reasoning_surface_guard.py` — absolute import of `_grounding` via the same sys.path pattern CP3 used for `_specificity` / `_scenario_detector`; `main()` wiring after Layer 2 (runs only when status still `ok` after Layer 2; "reject" downgrades to `incomplete`, "advisory" emits stderr and continues).
- `tests/test_layer3_grounding_hot_path.py` (new) — 21 tests across 7 classes: entity extractor FP-aversion (6), gate logic pure function (4), grounding against a tmp-project fixture (4), hot-path integration through `guard.main()` (3), honest Layer-3 limit on pure-English spec fluent-vacuous examples (2), graceful degrade (1), latency bounded (1).
- Tests: **361/361 passing** (340 baseline + 21 new). Zero regressions. No fixture migrations required — existing 340 tests' disconfirmation / unknowns strings contain no entity-shaped tokens the narrow extractor captures.
- **Hot-path behavior change:** surfaces that name entity-shaped tokens (snake_case / SCREAMING_CASE / path+ext / hex SHA) which do not grep to the project tree are now rejected when grounded ≥ 2 AND not_found/named > 0.5. Pure-English fluent prose with no extractable entities honestly passes Layer 3 — this is the compose-across-layers discipline per spec § Layer 2 Composition cost; those surfaces are closed at CP6 Layer 4 `verification_trace`, not CP4.
- **Honest CP4 limit (tested explicitly, not latent):** the three spec fluent-vacuous examples that CP3 could not catch (*"the migration may produce unexpected behavior..."*, *"if the build process exhibits anomalous behavior..."*, *"if results diverge from expectations..."*) contain no entity-shaped tokens. Layer 3 passes them intentionally. They close at CP6 Layer 4.

**CP3 bundle (committed `101d3cd`):**

- Layer 2 classifier in the hot path, blueprint-aware. 2 fixture migrations (sharpened with observables). 14 new tests. Tests: 340/340 passing at commit. Narrative: `docs/PROGRESS.md` Event 9. Caught 2 of 5 spec fluent-vacuous examples at Layer 2 alone; remaining 3 closed at CP4 + CP6 combined.

**CP2 bundle (committed `6ceaa44`):**

- Scenario detector + blueprint registry substrate + generic_fallback.yaml + 22 tests. Hot path untouched at CP2.

**CP1 bundle (committed on `f5f8d0f` / `3d4b20a` / `ce0f4e3`):**

- Code extraction + Blueprint-D self-dogfood cascade sync across 13 surfaces. Narrative preserved in annotated tag `v1.0-rc-cp1` (`git show v1.0-rc-cp1`).
- Follow-up fix: `2a2ed68` — pytest pythonpath closes runtime half of deferred-discovery #8.

**The ten v1.0 RC checkpoints:**

1. **CP1 — extract `_specificity.py`.** Move `_classify_disconfirmation` from `src/episteme/_profile_audit.py` to `core/hooks/_specificity.py`. Phase 12 imports from the new module; behavior unchanged. Tests stay green.
2. **CP2 — scenario detector + blueprint registry.** New `core/hooks/_scenario_detector.py`; new `core/blueprints/` directory with generic-fallback blueprint + registry loader. No behavior change until CP5 wires Fence Reconstruction.
3. **CP3 — Layer 2 in the hot path, blueprint-aware.** `reasoning_surface_guard.py` calls `_classify_disconfirmation` against the selected blueprint's fields (generic for now). Rejects on `tautological`/`unknown`; advisory on `absence`.
4. **CP4 — Layer 3 contextual grounding, blueprint-aware.** New `core/hooks/_grounding.py`. Blueprint-aware entity extraction + project grep. FP-averse gating.
5. **CP5 — Blueprint B (Fence Reconstruction), realized end-to-end + first synthesis output.** `core/blueprints/fence_reconstruction.yaml` populated; scenario detector wired to fire on constraint-removal patterns; Layer 2/3 validation against blueprint fields. On successful removal (rollback-path not triggered within window), emits a constraint-safety protocol entry to the framework — the first real Pillar 3 synthesis producer.
6. **CP6 — Layer 4 `verification_trace` schema.** Schema update with blueprint-shaped variants for Fence Reconstruction. Advisory for highest-impact ops in RC; required in v1.0.1. Axiomatic Judgment (decision + synthesis arms), Consequence Chain, and Blueprint D (cascade fields as stubs) ship as structure with advisory-only validation.
7. **CP7 — Pillar 2 hash chain + Pillar 3 substrate.** New `core/hooks/_chain.py` (shared SHA-256 chain), `core/hooks/_pending_contracts.py` (Layer 6 write), `core/hooks/_framework.py` (Pillar 3 framework read/write, hash-chained across protocol entries AND `deferred_discovery` entries), `core/hooks/_context_signature.py` (canonicalization for framework query). Phase 12 audit gains chain-verification precondition.
8. **CP8 — Layer 8 spot-check sampling.** 10%→5% schedule (30-day decay from install); blueprint-fired surfaces at 2× base; synthesized protocols at 2× base with a "protocol quality" verdict dimension; Blueprint D resolutions at 2× base with a "cascade-theater vs real sync" verdict dimension; queue hash-chained; new `episteme review` CLI.
9. **CP9 — Pillar 3 active guidance surface.** Framework query after scenario detection, before blueprint enforcement. One stderr advisory per op (highest-believability match). SessionStart digest ("N protocols synthesized since last session. M deferred discoveries pending triage."). New `episteme guide [--context <keyword>] [--since <date>] [--deferred]` CLI — minimal version; rich interactive mode in v1.0.1.
10. **CP10 — Blueprint D (Architectural Cascade & Escalation) scaffolding.** `core/blueprints/architectural_cascade.yaml` populated. New `core/hooks/_cascade_detector.py` implementing the four selector triggers (cross-surface-ref diff check, refactor/rename/deprecate lexicon, self-escalation `flaw_classification`, generated-artifact symbol-reference check). Structural validation of `patch_vs_refactor_evaluation` + `blast_radius_map[]` + `sync_plan[]`. Every `deferred_discoveries[]` entry is hash-chained into the framework as a `deferred_discovery` record at PreToolUse — operator-visible payoff even before retrospective sync-plan verification (that lands in v1.0.1). Phase 12 audit gains deferred-discovery frequency-by-class and aging queries.

**Engineering session state at v0.11.0 tag:**

- Tests: 202/202 passing (baseline for RC work; each CP adds ~15–25 tests).
- Release: `v0.11.0` tagged and pushed, CHANGELOG entry landed, `MANIFEST.sha256` regenerated (commit `a78c73e`).
- RC engineering checklist closed during the 0.11.0 cycle: items 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 11 (see § "Road to v1.0.0 RC" below). Items 9, 10 remain as Class B (maintainer design calls). Items 12–15 remain as RC-cycle fixes.
- Cognitive-adoption RC gates (21–28) remain as soak-window criteria; their measurement begins once CP1–CP10 land and the RC soak opens.

**Load-bearing spec constraints (any change is a governance event, not an implementation tweak):**

- The three pillars — Cognitive Blueprints, Append-Only Hash Chain, Framework Synthesis & Active Guidance.
- The four named blueprints — **Axiomatic Judgment** (per-decision source-conflict synthesis), **Fence Reconstruction** (constraint-removal safety synthesis), **Consequence Chain** (irreversible-op decomposition), **Architectural Cascade & Escalation** (emergent-flaw patch-vs-refactor + cascade sync + deferred-discovery logging) — plus the **generic maximum-rigor fallback** (Consequence-Chain-shaped) for unclassified high-impact ops.
- The three orthogonal pairs — L2+L3, L4+L6, L5+L7 — plus the new pair introduced by Pillar 1 (blueprint-selector × L8 selection sample).
- Hot-path ceiling: Layers 2–4 + scenario detector (including cascade detector) + framework query combined < 100 ms p95.
- Spot-check schedule: 10% for first 30 days (calendar-from-install), then 5%.
- Hash-chain scope in RC: episodic tier + pending contracts + framework protocols (including `deferred_discovery` records) only (NOT `derived_knobs.json`, NOT profile-axis changes).
- BYOS stance: kernel intercepts state mutation regardless of tool/MCP/agent source; no tool-specific validation paths; no prescriptive tool-usage in blueprints.
- Pillar 3 guidance is advisory-only, never blocking.
- Blueprint D dogfood — the kernel must satisfy Blueprint D on its own architectural edits (editing episteme while editing episteme). Bypassing is an RC failure regardless of test count.

## Road to v1.0.0 RC — concrete checklist (drafted 2026-04-20)

Derived from a read-only audit of the CLI + stateful interceptor (see *Deep Audit Discoveries* in `docs/PROGRESS.md`). Ordered by blocking-weight: items above a line block RC tag; items below are RC → GA polish.

### Blocking for v1.0.0-rc1 tag

1. **Close 0.11.0 first.** ✅ **DONE** — v0.11.0 tagged and shipped 2026-04-21. CHANGELOG entry landed, version reconcile complete across `pyproject.toml` / `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` / `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `kernel/MANIFEST.sha256` regenerated (commit `a78c73e`). The RC cycle is now open against the reframed spec at `docs/DESIGN_V1_0_SEMANTIC_GOVERNANCE.md` (status `approved (reframed, second pass)`).

**NEW — Spec-level blocking items for v1.0.0-rc1:**

1a. **Implement the 9-CP plan** per `docs/DESIGN_V1_0_SEMANTIC_GOVERNANCE.md` § Implementation sequencing. CP1 is the next executable unit; see the "Resume here" block above for the full checkpoint list. Each CP pauses for review; tests stay green at every commit.

1b. **End-to-end dogfood gate — Pillar 3 works, not just runs.** After 30 days of real use on the maintainer's tier, the framework must hold ≥ 3 non-trivial synthesized protocols AND ≥ 1 must fire as guidance on a subsequent op AND the operator must have a spot-check verdict recorded on that firing (useful / vague / overfit). Empty framework or never-fires guidance is a cognitive-level failure of Pillar 3 regardless of whether the code runs green. Criterion lives in the spec § Verification.

1c. **Chain integrity gate — all three streams.** Chain verification succeeds across the RC soak window for episodic tier, pending contracts, AND framework protocols. Any chain-broken event during soak is investigated and root-caused before GA.
2. **Fix `pytest` out-of-box.** `pyproject.toml` has no `[tool.pytest.ini_options]`. A fresh clone + `pip install pytest` + `pytest` produces 6 collection errors (`ModuleNotFoundError: episteme`). Only works with `PYTHONPATH=src pytest` or editable install. NEXT_STEPS already claims "176 passed, zero regressions" — true only under a non-obvious env. One-line fix: add `[tool.pytest.ini_options]` with `pythonpath = ["src"]` + `testpaths = ["tests"]`. Audit verified 176 pass under that config.
3. **Redact secrets in telemetry before write.** `core/hooks/reasoning_surface_guard.py::_write_prediction` and `core/hooks/calibration_telemetry.py::_write_telemetry` log `command_executed` verbatim to `~/.episteme/telemetry/*-audit.jsonl`. Inline secrets (e.g. `curl -H "Authorization: Bearer …"`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=… terraform apply`) land in plaintext indefinitely. `episodic_writer.py` already redacts; lift that helper out and reuse it in both telemetry writers. Zero-cost, high-leverage confidentiality fix.
4. **Cross-platform support for `state_tracker.py`.** `import fcntl` at module top-level fails on Windows. Hook ships as part of a cross-platform repo; `pyproject.toml` classifiers don't exclude Windows. Wrap the import in `try/except ImportError` and fall back to no-lock (docstring already says "degrade to last-write-wins on exotic filesystems" — extend that path to "no fcntl available"). Small change; unblocks the Windows install story.
5. **Install UX — one-command bootstrap.** `INSTALL.md` currently documents a multi-step flow. For RC, ship `curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/junjslee/episteme/main/scripts/install.sh | sh` (or the equivalent via `pipx install episteme`), and verify `episteme doctor` green on macOS + Linux after a clean install. Windows path (WSL acceptable for RC; native for GA).
6. **Release-signing + provenance.** Publish to PyPI with SLSA provenance / sigstore attestation. At minimum: tag signed with GPG, `pip install episteme==1.0.0rc1` lands the same bytes as `pip install git+…@v1.0.0rc1`.

### Fix during RC cycle (non-blocking for rc1, blocking for GA)

7. **Episode ID collision.** `_evolve_run` uses `ts.strftime('%Y%m%d-%H%M%S')` as `episode_id`; two `episteme evolve run` calls in the same second silently overwrite each other's episode files. Append microseconds or a short random suffix.
8. **`episteme evolve friction --top-n` negative-value slip.** `argparse` accepts `--top-n -1`, which slices from the end of a Python list and produces garbage output. Either constrain via `type=` with a positive-int checker or clamp `max(0, top_n)` in `_render_friction_report`.
9. **`evolve promote` / `evolve rollback` preserve provenance history.** Both overwrite `provenance.captured_at`, losing the original capture timestamp. Append to a `history: []` list instead of replacing.
10. **`evolve promote --force` must write an audit entry.** Bypassing `gate_result.passed` currently has no tamper-evident trail. Append to `~/.episteme/audit.jsonl` with `forced: true` on every force-promote.
11. **Corrupt `.episteme/reasoning-surface.json` silently reads as "missing".** A malformed JSON file produces the same message as an absent one, so the operator never learns their surface file is broken. Emit a one-line stderr note when the file exists but fails parse.
12. **Auto-mutation of `kernel/CONSTITUTION.md` from friction reports (operator-review gated).** The heuristic already names which unknowns are chronically under-elaborated; wire a `--apply` flag that proposes a CONSTITUTION diff, never auto-merged. Same pattern at `OPERATOR_PROFILE_SCHEMA.md` level via the 0.11 profile-audit loop.
13. **Fence-Check hook.** Failure mode 7 (constraint removal without understanding) is named in docs but has no hook counter. When the agent proposes removing an entry from an `.episteme/*` policy file or a security-relevant config, require a one-line "this constraint exists because …" note in the Reasoning Surface before allowing the edit.
14. **Controller-variety escalation prototype.** Failure mode 9. For PreToolUse on actions matching *neither* allow nor deny pattern sets, route to explicit human confirmation rather than defaulting to allow. Start narrow (network egress) to bound blast radius.
15. **Cross-runtime MCP proxy daemon.** Closes intra-call write-then-execute (see *Architectural bypass vectors* below). The v0.10.0 state tracker fires PostToolUse — *after* the write has landed inside a single Bash call. The daemon inspects at the syscall boundary and refuses to return control until the contract is satisfied.

### Discretionary / polish (nice for RC, not blocking)

16. **`evolve friction --since=30d` window.** `_load_telemetry_pairs` loads all history unbounded; long-running installs slow linearly.
17. **`_should_track` signal-to-noise.** Currently tracks every extension-less file (Makefile, Dockerfile, README) — TTL bounds it but inflates the state file.
18. **Lockfile cleanup.** `~/.episteme/state/session_context.json.lock` persists forever. Benign but lint-worthy.
19. **Ship a reference evaluator for `episteme evolve run`.** Currently `_default_evaluation_report` is a zero-metric stub; an episode is always born with `gate_result.passed: False`. For 1.0: either (a) document this is stub-by-design and the operator wires their own, or (b) ship a minimal reference harness that exercises the demo suite.
20. **Three-path adoption model** (already scoped to 0.12.0 below — lift into RC if it lands quickly; otherwise 1.0.1).

### Verification for RC gate — engineering

Before tagging `v1.0.0-rc1`:
- `PYTHONPATH=src pytest` → 176/176 passing (or test count updated, zero regressions).
- Plain `pytest` from a fresh clone → same result (item 2 closes this gap).
- `episteme doctor` green on macOS + Linux.
- Manual smoke: `episteme init`, `episteme sync`, declare a Reasoning Surface, run an allowed high-impact op, run a blocked one, verify audit + telemetry + episodic records written and redaction applied (item 3).
- `episteme evolve friction` against ≥ 7 days of real telemetry — Friction Report renders, no crash, no secrets in output.
- `episteme kernel verify` clean (item 1 — MANIFEST regen).
- **Installable-plugin smoke test** (added 2026-04-23, post Event 27 issue #1 hotfix; **blood-proven necessary by Event 30** — a second manifest-shape bug slipped past the engineering gate on the same tag). From a fresh Claude Code cache: `/plugin marketplace add junjslee/episteme` then `/plugin install episteme@episteme` exits successfully with (a) no manifest-validation error AND (b) no `Failed to load hooks from ...: Duplicate hooks file detected` error. Any "Validation errors: ..." or "Duplicate hooks file detected" output is a pre-tag blocker. Catches the class of regressions Events 27 and 30 closed (manifest field shape drift between what Claude Code's schema accepts / the loader expects vs. what episteme ships). Gap named in Event 27 deferred discovery #1 and confirmed load-bearing in Event 30 — this line closes it for future tags.
- **Manifest-field-shape audit** (added 2026-04-23, post Event 30). Companion to the install smoke: a static validator that enumerates every field the Claude Code plugin-manifest schema accepts (currently: `agents`, `skills`, `commands`, `hooks`, and any future additions) and asserts the on-disk shape matches what the runtime expects — flagging single-string legacy values for fields spec'd as arrays, and flagging explicit entries that collide with the loader's auto-discovery paths (e.g. `hooks: "./hooks/hooks.json"` when `hooks/hooks.json` is the loader's canonical auto-load target). Event 27 caught one such drift (`agents` as string); Event 30 caught a second (`hooks` as explicit self-reference); without this validator, a third is statistically expected before GA. Gap named in Event 30 deferred discovery #1.
- **Pre-tag version-string consistency.** One-line grep-assertion before each tag: `pyproject.toml` `[project].version` == `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` `.version` == `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` `.plugins[0].version` == the tag to be applied. Event 27 closed a drift where `pyproject.toml` was at `1.0.0-rc1` but both `.claude-plugin/*.json` were stuck at `0.11.0`. Gap named in Event 27 deferred discovery #2.

### Verification for RC gate — cognitive adoption (the soul of the product)

The engineering gates above verify the *enforcement arm*. They are necessary and insufficient. `episteme` is a framework for how an agent should think; the blocker exists only to keep that framework from being skipped under pressure. A 1.0 that passes every engineering gate but never changes how decisions are actually made is a 1.0 of the wrong product. Add these gates alongside the engineering ones:

21. **Reasoning-quality signal visible in the episodic tier.** Over ≥ 7 days of real use, inspect `~/.episteme/memory/episodic/*.jsonl`. For every high-impact decision, the record carries a *Reasoning-Surface snapshot* with a non-lazy `core_question`, ≥ 1 substantive unknown, and a falsifiable disconfirmation. Gate: sample 20 random records — 0 with lazy placeholders, 0 with disconfirmations that don't name an observable outcome. If this fails, the guard is being satisfied mechanically (operator / agent is producing fluent-looking surfaces to get through the block) rather than internalized. That is a cognitive-product failure regardless of whether the blocker is working.
22. **Disconfirmation actually fires.** Against the same window: at least one recorded decision where the declared disconfirmation *did* fire (the predicted-wrong condition was observed) AND the downstream action changed in response. Zero fires across 7 days of real work is the signature of disconfirmations written to pass validation rather than to be tested. If this happens, raise the minimum-specificity threshold (via `disconfirmation_specificity_min` in `~/.episteme/derived_knobs.json`) until declarations become honest.
23. **Facts / inferences / preferences stay separated in session artifacts.** The Reasoning Surface schema declares `knowns`, `unknowns`, `assumptions`, and (implicitly) preferences as distinct fields. Sample 10 recent surfaces — count how often a preference ("we should use X") is filed as a known, or an inference ("this probably works because …") is filed as a fact. Target < 10%. Above that, the separation is formal only and the kernel is not producing the distinction it claims to enforce.
24. **Hypothesis → test → update cycle is observable.** Pick 5 recent Reasoning Surfaces with a declared hypothesis. Trace forward in the episodic tier: was the hypothesis validated, refined, or invalidated by the outcome? Target ≥ 3 of 5 have an explicit update ("hypothesis invalidated, revised to Y" in the next surface or a reflective-tier entry). If 0 of 5, the framework is producing hypotheses but not closing the loop — the agent is declaring thinking, not doing thinking.
25. **Profile-audit loop catches reasoning drift (not just outcome drift).** Phase 12 deliverable. The audit loop compares episodic-tier reasoning patterns against the operator's declared cognitive profile (e.g. `dominant_lens: failure-first` should show up as failure-mode inversion in the decision record). Gate: the loop surfaces ≥ 1 real drift detection against the maintainer's own profile over the RC cycle. If it never surfaces anything, the loop is documentation — not a control signal.
26. **Semantic-tier proposals encode *how we think*, not just *what we do*.** The promotion job should emit patterns like "decisions flagged `domain: complex` but treated as `complicated` → recurring disconfirmation miss," not just "git push failed 3× this week." Sample semantic proposals from the 0.11 promotion job — ≥ 1 must name a *reasoning-shape* regularity, not only an outcome regularity.
27. **Failure-mode taxonomy is load-bearing in real decisions.** `kernel/FAILURE_MODES.md` names nine. Over the RC window, episodic records should *cite* at least three distinct failure-mode ids as the reason a decision was re-framed (e.g. "WYSIATI fired — unknowns field was blank because context was silent, not because unknowns were absent"). Zero citations means the taxonomy is decorative.
28. **Kernel doesn't need the kernel.** A narrower cut of #23: when working *on* episteme itself (as in this session), the maintainer's own decisions should show up in the episodic tier with the same discipline demanded of downstream users. If the kernel's author bypasses the kernel while working on the kernel, the product fails the dogfood test.

**Interpretation.** Gates 21–28 fail when the framework is producing artifacts rather than changing cognition. Every failure mode above has the same shape: *mechanically-compliant, epistemically-empty*. The enforcement arm cannot fix this — it can only prevent the *absence* of declarations. Fixing it requires sharper thresholds, clearer schema guidance, and operator review. Ship RC when both engineering gates and at least four of the eight cognitive gates pass against real usage, with the remaining four named as known-gaps in 1.0.1 scope.

## Immediate (v1.0 RC — drives from `docs/DESIGN_V1_0_SEMANTIC_GOVERNANCE.md`)

**v0.11.0 shipped 2026-04-21.** All fourteen phases of the 0.11.0 plan closed (phases 1–11 + coherence pass + raster follow-up + Mermaid replacement + phase 12 profile-audit loop + phase 13 changelog/version reconcile + phase 14 MANIFEST regeneration). Tag `v0.11.0` pushed; `kernel/CHANGELOG.md` current; `MANIFEST.sha256` fresh. Full historical detail in the *Closed in 0.11.0* section below.

The v1.0 RC cycle is now open. The entry point, 9-CP plan, and load-bearing constraints are in the *Resume here* block at the top of this file. The approved spec is `docs/DESIGN_V1_0_SEMANTIC_GOVERNANCE.md` — *Design — Causal-Consequence Scaffolding & Protocol Synthesis — v1.0 RC* — status `approved (reframed, second pass)` as of 2026-04-21.

**Why the v1.0 RC scope is not just "ship the blocker at more contexts."** The spec reframes the whole kernel around three axes the substrate cannot perform natively: (1) causal-consequence modeling per action, (2) protocol synthesis from conflicting sources into a tamper-evident framework, (3) active guidance using accumulated protocols at future decision points. The 9 CPs build these three pillars in layered commits; CP5 (Fence Reconstruction end-to-end including synthesis output) and CP9 (active-guidance surface) are the operator-visible payoffs — the rest are substrate.

## Follow-on wiring (can land alongside phases 11–14 or in 0.11.1)

Phase 9 shipped one knob end-to-end (`disconfirmation_specificity_min` + companion `unknown_specificity_min`). The other six declared knobs are *computed* in `~/.episteme/derived_knobs.json` but *not consumed* by any hook yet. Each is a small pattern-match on phase 9's wiring:

- **`default_autonomy_class`** → gate in `block_dangerous.py` or a new PreToolUse escalation shim. Highest-leverage of the six: actually changes which commands an agent can run without confirmation.
- **`noise_watch_set`** → surfaced by `session_context.py` at SessionStart as an explicit "watch for: status-pressure, false-urgency" banner. Cheap to wire.
- **`preferred_lens_order`** → pure advisory; inject into the Reasoning Surface template or the Frame-stage prompts.
- **`explanation_form`**, **`checkpoint_frequency`**, **`scaffold_vs_terse`**, **`fence_check_strictness`** → same shape, progressively lower leverage.

Episodic-tier also has three declared triggers not yet firing (only high-impact pattern match is active). Adding them:
- **Hook-blocked action** → episodic_writer reads `~/.episteme/audit.jsonl` at PostToolUse and correlates blocks to the current tool call.
- **Disconfirmation-fired** → needs the Verify stage to signal; not available without explicit operator interaction or a Verify hook.
- **Operator-elected** → needs a CLI / slash-command affordance (`episteme note "<text>"`).

## Carryover from 0.10.0 — still live, independent of the 0.11 pass

- **First friction-report pass** — after ~1 week of real v0.10.0 use, run `episteme evolve friction` against accumulated telemetry. Answer: do the ranked unknowns point at real calibration debt? Are the friction-prone ops the same ones humans are already suspicious of? Tune the heuristic (currently: skip empty envelopes; rank by raw frequency) if the top-N doesn't track intuition.
- **Stateful-interception FP audit** — scan `~/.episteme/audit.jsonl` for blocks carrying the `via agent-written <path>` label. Any false positive here is a regression-budget hit.
- **Tag and push `v0.10.0`** after one-week soak if no FP spike and no telemetry anomalies. Independent of 0.11.

## Short-term

- **Three-path adoption model (scoped to 0.12.0; endorsed by operator).** Today the repo ships the maintainer's real profile in `core/memory/global/` and `.gitignore`'s comment tells forkers to "edit them to make them your own." That implicitly forces the author's values as the forker's starting point — a schema violation (OPERATOR_PROFILE_SCHEMA.md section 4b: "null = unknown, not default"). Replace with three explicit on-ramps:
  - **Example mode** — maintainer's real filled profile ships at `examples/author/global/` as a worked reference. Forker reads, doesn't copy. Preserves the schema's "a profile must distinguish this operator" rule.
  - **Ingest mode** — `episteme init --ingest=author` copies the example verbatim to `core/memory/global/` as a quickstart. Honest: the forker's agent behaves *as the maintainer's agent would*, with a visible `confidence: ingested-from-author` metadata flag per axis so the profile-audit loop surfaces it for re-elicitation over time.
  - **Fill mode** — `episteme init` runs interactive elicitation, prompting axis-by-axis against the anchor text from the schema. Leaves anything unelicited as `null`.
- **Proposal acceptance step (phase 11.5).** `episteme memory accept <proposal-id>` reads the reflective proposal, promotes it to `~/.episteme/memory/semantic/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` under the schema, and marks the proposal `status: accepted` with a back-reference to the semantic record. Deferred until real usage shows whether per-proposal or bulk review is the better UX.
- **Auto-refinement of `CONSTITUTION.md` from the friction report.** The heuristic already names which unknowns are chronically under-elaborated; wire a `--apply` flag that proposes a CONSTITUTION.md diff, gated by human review — never auto-merged. Same pattern applied at `OPERATOR_PROFILE_SCHEMA.md` level via the 0.11 profile-audit loop.
- **Fence-check enforcement in hooks.** Failure mode 7 (constraint removal without understanding) is named in the docs but has no hook counter. When the agent proposes removing an entry from an `.episteme/*` policy file, a forbidden-patterns file, or a security-relevant config, require a one-line "this constraint exists because …" note in the Reasoning Surface before allowing the edit. Smaller than a full constraint-archaeology feature; closes the cheapest version of the gap.
- **Controller-variety escalation prototype.** Failure mode 9. For PreToolUse events on actions that match *neither* the allow nor deny pattern sets, route to explicit human confirmation rather than defaulting to allow. Start with a narrow action class (network egress) to bound the blast radius of a wrong default.

## Medium-term (roadmap)

- Multi-operator mode design (Gap C) — deferred past 0.10.0; requires profile schema rework.
- **Cross-runtime MCP proxy daemon — the next real Sovereign Kernel step.** v0.10.0 gives the kernel *memory* across calls. The cross-runtime daemon gives the kernel *mediation* at the syscall boundary: pause execution between the write and the exec, inspect every subprocess fork, and refuse to return control to the agent until the contract is satisfied. This is what closes intra-call indirection (see below). Blocked on telemetry-informed demand evidence from v0.10.0.

## Architectural bypass vectors — remaining open after v0.10.0

v0.10.0 closed write-then-execute *across tool calls* (state tracker + deep-scan) and variable-indirection (`bash $F` against any recent tracked write). These remain:

1. **Intra-call write-then-execute.** `echo "git push" > s.sh && bash s.sh` as a single Bash tool call is caught today only by the in-command text scanner — state tracking fires PostToolUse, after the write has landed. Fix needs a cross-runtime proxy daemon. Targeted at 0.11+.
2. **Dynamic shell assembly.** `A=git; B=push; $A $B` — unchanged from 0.8.1. Would require a lightweight shell parser, or a deny-by-default policy on `$()`/backticks (legitimate automation break). Deferred pending cost/benefit review.
3. **Heredocs with variable terminators.** The v0.10-α redirect parser is regex-based and misses `cat <<"$EOF" > f`. A shell-parser dependency is the fix; weighed against its cost.
4. **Scripts > 64 KB (scan) / > 256 KB (hash).** Unchanged caps. Raising them increases hook latency and creates a DoS surface on pathologically large files. Accepted until a real FN is reported.

## Closed in 0.11.0 (phases 1–11)

- **Phase 11 — semantic-tier promotion job.** New `src/episteme/_memory_promote.py` + CLI subcommand `episteme memory promote`. Reads episodic tier, clusters by `(domain_marker, primary high-impact pattern)`, computes per-cluster success rate + disconfirmation fire rate, emits deterministic proposals to `~/.episteme/memory/reflective/semantic_proposals.jsonl`. Proposal ids are stable hashes of the signature + sorted evidence refs, so re-running on identical input produces byte-identical output. Never touches the semantic tier; promotion is explicit. End-to-end verified with 6 synthetic records → 2 proposals (git push mixed, npm publish typically-succeeds). 19 new tests.
- **Phase 9 — profile becomes control signal.** New `core/hooks/_derived_knobs.py` (axis-to-knob derivation + reader/writer). `reasoning_surface_guard.py` replaces module-level `MIN_DISCONFIRMATION_LEN` / `MIN_UNKNOWN_LEN` constants with lookups against `~/.episteme/derived_knobs.json`, fallback 15. For the maintainer's v2 profile the minimum raises 15 → 27; an 18-char disconfirmation now fails, a 39-char passes. First end-to-end proof the v2 profile modulates hook behavior. 17 new tests.
- **Phase 10 — episodic-tier writer.** New PostToolUse hook `core/hooks/episodic_writer.py` fires on high-impact Bash pattern match; assembles a record per the `memory-contract-v1` schema (common.json + episodic_record.json); appends to `~/.episteme/memory/episodic/YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl`. Reasoning-Surface snapshot attached when present; secrets redacted before write; provenance confidence reflects available signal. Wired into `hooks/hooks.json` PostToolUse/Bash alongside `state_tracker` and `calibration_telemetry`, all async. Correlation-id algorithm mirrors calibration telemetry so records join. 19 new tests; end-to-end smoke-test verified a real record at `~/.episteme/memory/episodic/2026-04-20.jsonl`.
- **Operator profile v2 filled.** `core/memory/global/operator_profile.md` migrated. 6 process axes rescored 0–3 → 0–5. All 9 cognitive-style axes populated (3 flipped to `elicited` based on source-doc citations: `abstraction_entry`, `explanation_depth`, `asymmetry_posture`; 5 remain `inferred` pending phase-12 audit). Expertise map populated.
- **Test suite 121 → 176** (55 new across phases 9/10/11). Zero regressions.

## Closed in 0.11.0-entry (docs-only pass)

- **Attribution surface expansion.** `kernel/REFERENCES.md` primary-source count 14 → 23 — added Ashby (requisite variety), Gall (working-simple precedes working-complex), Tetlock (calibration), Laplace/Jaynes (probabilistic inference), Goodhart/Strathern (measure-as-target drift), Klein (recognition-primed decision), Chesterton (the fence), Feynman (self-deception), Festinger (cognitive dissonance). Secondary: Tulving/Squire, Snowden, Wittgenstein. No buzzword names leak into body docs.
- **Governance-layer failure modes named.** `kernel/FAILURE_MODES.md` adds modes 7 (constraint removal without understanding → Fence-Check), 8 (measure-as-target drift → scorecard audit vs outcome), 9 (controller-variety mismatch → escalate-by-default). Kept separate from the Kahneman six so that taxonomy stays clean.
- **Reasoning Surface — evidence-weighted update mechanic, `domain` marker, `tacit_call` marker.** Closes Gap D and the Cynefin classification gap. Assumptions no longer flip-to-Known on first evidence; they carry updated plausibility. Domain (Clear/Complicated/Complex/Chaotic) precedes the four fields. `tacit_call: true` relaxes Knowns for judgment-driven decisions without relaxing accountability.
- **Kernel limits 7 and 8.** Rule-based governance limit (controller coverage < action space → escalate, not default-allow/deny) and scorecard-as-target limit (profile axes are hypotheses, audited against episodic record, drift allowed).
- **Operator profile schema v2.** Two scorecard layers: process (0–5 with anchor text) + cognitive-style (9 typed axes — dominant lens, noise signature, abstraction entry, decision cadence, explanation depth, feedback mode, uncertainty tolerance, asymmetry posture, fence discipline). Per-axis metadata (`confidence`, `last_observed`, `evidence_refs[]`, `drift_signal`). `expertise_map` field. Declared *derived behavior knobs* adapters compute from axes — the bridge from "profile is documentation" to "profile is control signal." Audit Discipline section counters measure-as-target drift.
- **Memory architecture contract — new `kernel/MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md`.** Five tiers (working / episodic / semantic / procedural / reflective), each with declared purpose / lifetime / writer / reader. Retrieval is query-by-situation with similarity × recency × outcome-weight ranking. Promotion is gated: episodic → semantic requires pattern + outcome stability; semantic → profile-drift proposal requires long-window conviction and operator review — never auto-merged. Forgetting is declared per tier (TTL + compaction). Write/read discipline specified per workflow stage. Integrity guarantees: episodic append-only, promotion idempotent, forgetting itself logged.
- **SUMMARY and README updates.** Six-modes table expanded to nine. Operator-profile-v2 and memory-architecture paragraphs added to SUMMARY. File list in README adds `MEMORY_ARCHITECTURE.md`.

## Closed in 0.10.0

- **Stateful interception.** Cross-call memory shipped. `core/hooks/state_tracker.py` persists agent-written file paths + sha256 + ts to `~/.episteme/state/session_context.json` (24 h TTL). `reasoning_surface_guard.py` consults the store at execute time, deep-scanning recently-written files referenced by name OR by variable-indirection shape (`bash $F`).
- **Heuristic friction analyzer.** `episteme evolve friction` pairs prediction↔outcome telemetry by `correlation_id`, flags `exit_code ≠ 0` despite positive predictions, ranks most-violated unknowns and friction-prone ops, emits a Markdown Friction Report. Seed for automated CONSTITUTION.md refinement.
- **SVG control-plane diagram.** `docs/assets/architecture_v2.svg` replaces the ASCII diagram in `README.md`. Three-layer schematic; Stateful Interceptor loop and Calibration Telemetry feed visible.
- **Gap B — `last_elicited`.** Required metadata on `operator_profile.md`, mirrored to generated JSON; `episteme sync` injects a stale-context warning block when absent or >30 days old. Schema doc updated.
- **Final neutrality sweep.** No literal absolute-user-home strings remain in any committed doc.
- **Version reconcile** — `pyproject.toml`, `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` all at 0.10.0.
- Tests 86 → 121. 0 regressions.

## Closed in 0.9.0-entry
- **Repository is neutral.** Personal filesystem paths and operator identifiers removed from docs and demo artifacts. Public GitHub identity (`junjslee`) retained intentionally.
- **Calibration telemetry shipped (Gap A).** Prediction + outcome JSONL records in `~/.episteme/telemetry/YYYY-MM-DD-audit.jsonl`, joined by `correlation_id`. Local-only. Never transmitted.
- **Backtick substitution closed.** `` `git push` `` now normalizes the same way as `"git push"` and trips the pattern set.
- **`eval $VAR` blocked.** `eval "$CMD"`, `eval $CMD` block with label `"eval with variable indirection"`. Literal `eval "echo hi"` still passes.
- **Shell-script execution scanned.** Hook resolves and reads `.sh` files referenced by `./x.sh`, `bash x.sh`, `sh x.sh`, `zsh x.sh`, `source x.sh`, `. x.sh` and scans up to 64 KB for high-impact patterns. Missing scripts pass through (FP-averse).
- **Visual demo harness.** `scripts/demo_strict_mode.sh` is reproducible and recording-ready. `docs/CONTRIBUTING.md` documents the `asciinema rec → agg` flow.
- **Test coverage 17 → 35 guard/telemetry cases** (full suite 86 passed, 0 regressions).

## Closed in 0.8.1
- **Strict mode is default.** Missing / stale / incomplete / lazy Reasoning Surface → exit 2 (block). Opt out per-project via `.episteme/advisory-surface`.
- **Semantic validator shipped.** Lazy-token blocklist + 15-char minimums on `disconfirmation` and each `unknowns` entry. `"disconfirmation": "None"` and `"해당 없음"` no longer pass.
- **Command normalization closes three bypass shapes.** `subprocess.run(['git','push'])`, `os.system('git push')`, `sh -c 'npm publish'` all trip the same regex patterns as bare shell.
- **Block-mode stderr upgraded.** `"Execution blocked by Episteme Strict Mode. Missing or invalid Reasoning Surface."` + concrete validator reasons + advisory-mode opt-out pointer.
- **`episteme inject` reworked.** Default is no-marker (strict is default); `--no-strict` writes `advisory-surface` explicitly.

## Closed in 0.8.0
- Remove compat symlink `~/cognitive-os`
- Verify `/plugin marketplace add junjslee/episteme` resolves (user confirmed in-session)
- Tag + push `v0.8.0`
- Reconcile `pyproject.toml`, `plugin.json`, `marketplace.json` versions
