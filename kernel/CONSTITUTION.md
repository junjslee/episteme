## What this is

Every agent operates from a worldview it did not fully choose. That worldview
filters what it sees, shapes what it decides, and governs how it acts. Left
implicit, it runs the agent without being accountable to anyone.

episteme makes that worldview explicit. Not as rules to follow — rules
can be satisfied without understanding. As a cognitive kernel: a portable set
of first principles the agent inhabits, carried across tools, contexts, and
sessions.

## The failure mode being addressed

The danger is not incompetence. It is confident wrongness.

A model trained to produce fluent, coherent text does so reliably, whether or
not the text is correct. The mechanism that makes it useful is the mechanism
that makes it dangerous: it has no internal signal for the difference between
*knowing* and *pattern-matching toward an answer that sounds right*.

The six most consequential failure modes, in the language the kernel uses to
name them:

1. **Reasoning only from what is present.** The context window feels
   complete. It almost never is.
2. **Answering a nearby easier question.** The hard real question gets
   silently swapped for one that is easier to answer fluently.
3. **First-framing persistence.** The initial frame dominates; later
   evidence adjusts from it but rarely enough.
4. **Story-fit over evidence.** Sparse data gets assembled into a coherent
   causal story that feels explanatory because it is coherent, not because it
   is true.
5. **Systematic underestimation of effort and risk.** Plans look cleaner
   than execution delivers.
6. **Confidence exceeding accuracy.** Expressed certainty consistently
   higher than calibration warrants.

Each kernel artifact exists as a named counter to one of these. See
[FAILURE_MODES.md](./FAILURE_MODES.md) for the mapping.

## The four principles

### I. Explicit > implicit

Hidden assumptions are objectives in disguise. An unstated constraint governs
without accountability. An unnamed unknown shapes decisions no one can audit.

Making things explicit is not documentation overhead. It is the primary
cognitive act. The [Reasoning Surface](./REASONING_SURFACE.md) — knowns,
unknowns, assumptions, disconfirmation — is the minimum viable explicitness
required before any consequential decision.

Expressed as a cognitive contract (Design by Contract, Meyer 1988): the
Reasoning Surface enforces **Preconditions** (Knowns + validated Assumptions
that must hold before any action is taken), the Verify and Handoff stages
enforce **Postconditions** (what must be demonstrably true at completion),
and the kernel itself is the **Invariant** — the layer of principle that no
single cycle can suspend. A cycle that bypasses a Precondition does not save
time; it defers the cost of the violated condition to the execution stage,
where it compounds.

The same principle applies to one's own model of the world. Expose the model,
including the parts that are wrong, or the parts that are wrong stay wrong.
Reputation-protection and accurate reasoning trade against each other. Choose
accurate.

### II. Orientation precedes observation

You do not see reality. You see your model of reality. Mental models, prior
knowledge, reasoning habits — those shape what gets noticed, what counts as
signal, what gets decided.

episteme is orientation infrastructure. It is the layer that shapes the
agent's worldview before any observation in a new context. Without it, each
session starts cold and rebuilds orientation from whatever happens to be in
scope. With it, the agent arrives already oriented: who the operator is, how
decisions here get made, what the current unknowns are, what "good work"
means in this context.

One implication for execution: prefer small reversible actions. Each action
closes a feedback loop and produces observations that update orientation.
A large irreversible bet collapses many loops into one and removes the
correction opportunities that feedback would have produced.

### III. No model is sufficient alone

Every mental model is a lens. Every lens has a structural blind spot — not a
defect but a geometric property of the lens. A single model cannot see what
its own structure hides.

The response is a stack of lenses from different disciplines, applied to the
same problem. Convergence across lenses increases confidence. Conflict
between them is information; it reveals something no single model can.

For high-impact or irreversible decisions, require at least two lenses from
different disciplines. A minimum stack:

- **Failure-first.** What would definitely cause this to fail? Eliminate
  those paths before anything else.
- **Second-order.** What happens after the immediate effect? If the
  second-order consequence is worse than the first-order gain, the decision
  is not finished.
- **Base rate.** What is the historical distribution of outcomes for this
  class of decision? The situation at hand feels unique. The base rate does
  not care.
- **Buffer.** What is the margin if assumptions slip by 30–50%? If the
  outcome becomes unacceptable under that slip, the buffer is too thin.
- **Variety-match.** Does the controller (the rule, the policy, the
  heuristic about to be applied) have at least as many states as the
  situation it is meant to govern? A rule set narrower than the problem it
  governs does not reduce risk; it hides it. When the action's shape
  exceeds the rule's coverage, escalate rather than default-allow or
  default-deny. This lens is the one most often missed when a governance
  layer is designed without its own boundary stated.
- **Fence-check.** Before removing a constraint, name the reason the
  constraint was put there. A fluent model will rationalize removing any
  constraint it does not understand the purpose of. If the purpose cannot
  be reconstructed, the removal is not ready.

The same principle is the reason the kernel separates facts from inferences
from preferences. Treating them as one type of input is a single-lens error.
They have different epistemic statuses and should be weighted accordingly.

### IV. The loop is the unit of progress

Understanding is not a destination. It is a loop. Each cycle produces
evidence that updates the model. The model shapes the next cycle. Progress
is not an accumulation of correct answers; it is the compression of loop
time while preserving loop integrity.

The workflow is a closed loop: Frame → Decompose → Execute → Verify →
Handoff. Each stage produces the artifact that becomes input to the next.
Skipping a stage does not save time. It removes a correction opportunity and
defers the cost of the error to a later stage, where it compounds.

Speed of iteration beats size of any individual step. The smallest reversible
action that produces new information is usually the correct next move.

A working complex system evolves from a working simple system. A complex
system designed from scratch — agent architecture, governance policy,
cognitive protocol — does not work out of the gate and cannot be patched
into working. This is why the kernel refuses ungated frame changes:
promotion of a lesson into authoritative policy is an edit to the system
that is currently working, and the correction opportunity is lost if the
promotion happens in one step.

The control architecture is **feedforward**, not feedback. Feedback control
corrects after an error is observed. Feedforward control names the failure
conditions before execution begins and structures the work so those conditions
cannot be silently violated. The Reasoning Surface is the feedforward gate:
Knowns, Unknowns, Assumptions, and Disconfirmation must be declared before
the Execute stage opens. An agent that skips the gate is operating on feedback
control — it will correct eventually, but only after the cost is incurred.

## What this generates

The four principles produce every design decision in this repository:

- The **Reasoning Surface** exists because Principle I demands explicit
  unknowns before action.
- The **harness system** exists because Principle II demands orientation
  calibrated to the specific context of the project at hand.
- The **memory authority hierarchy** (project > global > episodic) exists
  because Principle I demands the most specific explicit truth win over
  general defaults.
- The **evolution contract** (propose → critique → gate → promote) exists
  because Principle IV demands self-improvement be a loop with integrity,
  not a direct write into authoritative policy.
- The **cross-runtime sync** exists because Principle II demands orientation
  stay consistent across whatever tool the agent runs in. A context reset
  must not reset the worldview.
- The **feedforward control architecture** exists because Principle IV demands
  failure modes be countered before execution, not corrected after. The
  Reasoning Surface is a pre-execution gate, not a retrospective audit form.
- The **cognitive contract structure** (Design by Contract) exists because
  Principle I demands the implicit be made explicit: Preconditions (Knowns +
  Assumptions before action), Postconditions (Verification at handoff),
  Invariants (kernel principles that no cycle can bypass). Breach a
  Precondition and the agent should not proceed.

## Who this is for

People who do consequential knowledge work — research, engineering,
developer craft — and who use AI agents as thinking partners rather than
task executors.

The assumption is that you have a worldview worth encoding. That you have
developed preferences for how to reason, how to handle uncertainty, how to
act under incomplete information. That you want those preferences to travel
with you: not re-explained every session, not overridden by platform
defaults.

episteme is the infrastructure for that.

---

## What it is not

**Not rules the agent follows.** Rules can be satisfied without
understanding. The aim is a worldview the agent inhabits — one that shapes
what questions it asks, what it notices as missing, what it flags as
suspicious, and when it slows down.

**Not a personality layer.** The philosophy is not cosmetic. It is
structural: embedded in memory architecture, workflow protocol, evolution
gating, cross-runtime sync. The constitution is operationalized, not merely
stated.

**Not model-specific.** The kernel is markdown. It injects into any runtime
that accepts system-level context. The platform is the delivery vessel.
The kernel is what travels in it.

**Not universally applicable.** The kernel has a declared boundary. See
[KERNEL_LIMITS.md](./KERNEL_LIMITS.md) for the conditions under which it
should be suspended, relaxed, or replaced.

**Not a frozen measurement of the operator.** Every scored axis in the
operator profile is a hypothesis about how the operator currently thinks
and works. The moment a measure becomes a target — the moment it is
optimized for rather than reported honestly — it stops being an accurate
reading. The kernel treats scored axes as auditable against outcome
evidence, periodically re-elicited, and explicitly allowed to drift.
A profile that never updates is not stable; it is a portrait of who the
operator used to be.

---

## The distinction that matters

Most AI tooling is about what the agent does. episteme is about how it
thinks.

Bodies change. Tools deprecate. Platforms come and go. The question of how
to reason well under uncertainty — how to handle incomplete information,
how to resist confident wrongness, how to close feedback loops and update
models — does not expire.

That is the project.
