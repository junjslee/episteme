"""CP3 tests — Layer 2 classifier wired into the hot path.

At CP3 `reasoning_surface_guard.py` consults:
  - `_scenario_detector.detect_scenario(...)` (always returns "generic" at
    CP2/CP3; CP5/CP10 plug real selectors)
  - `_blueprint_registry.load_registry().get("generic")` for the field
    contract
  - `_specificity._classify_disconfirmation(...)` per
    classifier-eligible field

Behavior change vs CP2: surfaces that pass Layer 1 (length + lazy-token)
but carry no specific observable in their `disconfirmation` /
`unknowns[]` entries are now rejected with a `(tautological)` verdict.
The five fluent-vacuous evasion examples from
docs/DESIGN_V1_0_SEMANTIC_GOVERNANCE.md § "Why this exists" should all
block. Absence-shape fields (`if no issues arise`) get a stderr
advisory but pass.

    - THREE examples block at Layer 4 — their verbs (`produces`,
